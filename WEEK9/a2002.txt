The program in African/African American Studies provides a cross-cultural and comparative framework for systematically studying the traditions and experiences of Africans in the New and Old Worlds. Students in this program are encouraged to develop their analytic, research and lit- erary skills through a critical study of patterns of western and African Civilizations in their interwoven complexity. The program provides a forum for addressing topics such as cultural and artistic creativity, construction of self, marginality, responses to exclusion, and the conjunction of issues related to gender, class, race and ethnicity.
The African/African American Studies Committee is composed of student, faculty, and administration members. It acts as a focal point for the encouragement of African/African American Studies at Carleton by actively urging departments and faculty members to offer courses in this field, by preparing each year a list of available courses and faculty resources, and by supporting the hiring of specialists in the field by various departments.
Numerous courses taught at Carleton have a bearing on African/African American Studies, in addition to those offered by the program itself. Students majoring in African/African American Studies have been able to create programs, on an individual basis, out of the available Carleton offerings, independent study, and, in some cases, off-campus study. Students interested in majoring in the field should consult the Director of African/African American Studies before the end of their sophomore year.
Requirements for a Major:
I. Admission to the program will depend upon the acceptance, by the African/African American Studies Committee, of a written proposal outlining the student's program of study. II. Survey Courses (18 credits). Students must take three of the following courses:

AFRICAN/AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Coordinator: Associate Professor Kofi Owusu
In this concentration, the study of the diaspora of African-derived peoples and cultures is rooted both in the mastery of a social science, arts and literature, or humanities discipline, and in cross- cultural, comparative interdisciplinary course work. The concentration will emphasize an inter- national perspective.
Requirements for the Concentration:
The African/African American Studies Concentration requires seven courses as follows:
Two survey courses
One team-taught, interdisciplinary course
Three distribution courses that are deemed essential to the concentration chosen from at
least two of the following groups: arts and literature, humanities, social sciences. Two of the three courses must be at the 300-level.

This program is designed to encourage and support the interdisciplinary study of American cul- ture. It draws upon the expertise of faculty in various disciplines and strives to understand the institutions, values, and beliefs that have shaped the experiences of U.S. residents. Recognizing the diverse and pluralistic nature of our society, the American Studies program enables the stu- dent to construct an interdisciplinary major around topics of the student's own choice such as urban studies, ethnicity, media, religion, gender roles, environmental thought or some other aspect of the American experience. The program supports interdisciplinary courses taught by Carleton faculty and it brings to campus nationally known visiting artists and scholars under the auspices of the Fred C. Andersen Foundation.

AMERICAN STUDIES
Requirements for a Major:
American Studies is an interdisciplinary major which a student constructs for himself or herself from offerings in two or more departments of instruction. To major in American Studies stu- dents must fill out an application form that can be obtained in the American Studies office in Goodsell Hall. The form asks the student to specify the general topic or focus of the major, to identify the disciplines which will constitute the support of his/her major, and to secure the sig- natures of two faculty, one from each of the supporting disciplines, who will agree to supervise the program.
Majors must complete 66 credits (eleven courses) in the following general areas: I. Core Courses: Each student must complete all four of these:
AMST 115: Introduction to American Studies
AMST 345: Methods in American Studies
AMST 396: Senior Seminar in American Studies
AMST 400: Colloquium and Integrative Exercise in American Studies
II. Survey Courses: Students must take three survey courses. Two of these three survey courses should be part of a two-term sequence in one department. The third survey course should be a one term course in a different department.
Two-term survey courses:
HIST 120-121: American Social History
HIST 220-221: African American History I and II
HIST 222-223: U.S. Women's History
One-term survey courses:
ARTH 160: American Art to 1940 (Not offered in 2001-2002.) ECON 232: American Economic History (Not offered in 2001-2002.) ENGL 112: Introduction to American Literature
POSC 122: Politics in America: Liberty and Equality
RELG 140: Religion and American Culture
III. Topical Courses: Each student must take four courses that deal with elements of the American experience that he/she has determined are central to his/her particular major. Courses that will fulfill this requirement are listed under American Studies in this catalog. In order that majors acquire the skills necessary to function independently, one of these courses must be sufficiently advanced within its discipline to carry a research component or its equivalent.

interdisciplinary course taught by a single member of the American Studies faculty, designed to introduce students to theories and methods in American Studies as they relate to a particular topic of inquiry. The course will encourage students to explore the various, sometimes conflicting ways in which a cul- tural or political phenomenon has been inter- preted by a number of different disciplines. The course will include both primary and sec- ondary texts, and will involve significant research for students preparing to work on the senior integrative exercise in the following term. This seminar will normally be taken by majors in their senior year. In 2001-2002 the topic of this seminar will be:
396. Seminar in American Studies: Post-Modern America An intensive interdisciplinary explo- ration of contemporary American popular cul- ture in the context of current social, economic, and technological changes. We will examine contemporary society and manners through the lens of television serials, print and broadcast journalism, cartoon art, popular music, movies, documentaries, spectacle events, and advertising. We will see how such topics are illuminated by novelists, sociolo- gists, historians, economists, geographers, and cultural studies theorists. Our goal as a class will be to develop standards suitable for criti- cally assessing representations of contempo- rary society. Prerequisite: American Studies 345. 6 credits, ND, Fall-M. Kowalewski

 spring term to satisfy the college "comps" requirement. The course will continue into the spring term; students will be evaluated for this course upon completion of the senior integrative exercise. 6 credits, S/NC, ND, Winter - R. Keiser
ARCHAEOLOGY CONCENTRATION (ARCN)
Coordinators: Professors Mary E. Savina, Nancy C. Wilkie
Archaeology is an interdisciplinary study of material artifacts in their cultural and environmen- tal context. The introductory and core courses of the concentration are designed to give students a methodological introduction to these three elements of artifacts, culture, and environment. In the supporting course projects, students take an interdisciplinary view, analyzing and interpret- ing material remains in a variety of ways. The range of supporting courses provides students with the flexibility to plan their own programs.
Students from any major may participate in the Archaeology Concentration. Students inter- ested in the concentration are encouraged to consult with the coordinators early in the sopho- more year in order to plan ahead and retain as much freedom of choice as possible in meeting the requirements of the program.
Requirements for the Concentration:
Eight courses are required for the concentration, including two introductory courses, two core courses, projects in three supporting courses, and one capstone seminar.
Introductory Courses (2):
GEOL 110: Introduction to Geology or
GEOL 120: Introduction to Environmental Geology and SOAN 110: Introduction to Anthropology
Core Courses (2):
GEOL 210: Geomorphology or
GEOL 258: Geology of Soils
SOAN 246: Archaeological Methodology
Projects in Supporting Courses (3):
A minimum of three supporting courses must be selected from among the college's offerings (other than the courses required for the concentration listed above). At least one of these courses must help students become familiar with a culture other than their own through work in History, Sociology/Anthropology, Latin American Studies, Asian Studies or any other program in which the material aspects of a given culture can be examined. In the three supporting courses, as part of the regular course requirements (or as a separate independent study, growing out of the course), students will write a paper or complete a project involving interpretation of archaeological materials. The topic of the paper should be negotiated by the student and the course instructor. If it is not possible to complete a project that uses archaeological data while taking the supporting course, the student must enroll in a separate two to six credit independ-
ARCHAEOLOGY CONCENTRATION 31

ARCHAEOLOGY CONCENTRATION
ent study for the purpose of writing such a paper. Students must fulfill normal prerequisites for the supporting courses before enrolling.
The concentration coordinators can advise students about which courses may fulfill these requirements. These courses are in many college departments and include courses taught by vis- iting professors. Students are encouraged to consult with the concentration coordinators for sug- gestions.
The concentration coordinators are available to help students and instructors of supporting courses. Students are responsible for giving a copy of each completed paper/project to the con- centration coordinators who will decide if the project is acceptable for the concentration. Capstone Seminar (1):
ARCN 395: Archaeology Seminar
Field Experience
Concentrators are strongly urged to gain practical field experience in archaeology over and above what is available through the capstone seminar. Field projects and off-campus programs with an archaeological component offer opportunities for such practical experience. For example, the ACM Costa Rica program offers field work in archaeology. The concentration coordinators can help arrange internships for concentrators with archaeological projects and laboratories, such as the Archaeometry Lab at the University of Minnesota - Duluth.
Archaeology Courses
395. Archaeology Seminar: Contemporary Issues in Archeology Cross-listed with SOAN 395. The course will focus on a wide range of contem- porary issues in archaeology, including archae- ological ethics, cultural property legislation, illicit collecting, looting of archaeological
sites, the role of nationalism in archaeology. The course serves as the capstone seminar for
the Archaeology Concentration. Enrollment is open to non-concentrators with permission of the instructors. 6 credits, SS, Spring Ñ

A faculty and student committee is in charge of a wide variety of special programs and activi- ties. Courses dealing with Asia are offered by various academic departments. There is no stan- dard major in Asian Studies, but students interested in majoring may submit their own plan for a major to the Asian Studies Committee for its consideration. Students may also major in a reg- ular department with a concentration in either East Asian Studies or South Asian Studies (see Concentrations).
Students interested in studying in Asia may apply to one of several overseas programs. Carleton cooperates with several other colleges to sponsor the Associated Kyoto Program, which takes 50 students and seven faculty members to Japan for an academic year. Carleton also partic- ipates in a one year program at Waseda University sponsored by ACM. The Program-in-India consists of six months stay in Pune, where students study Marathi, take academic courses cen- tered on India, and investigate an independent study topic. The program in Hong Kong at the Chinese University, also for students from ACM institutions, normally lasts one year, though a semester-long program is also possible. Carleton students also participate in the Council on International Educational Exchange program in the People's Republic of China, where they study at Beijing, Nanjing, or Fudan Universities.

The biochemistry program at Carleton rests on the close cooperation between the departments of Biology and Chemistry. Emerging as a recognized discipline early in the last century, bio- chemistry has grown into a vast subject that spans several established disciplines. It serves as the link between thefieldsof chemistry and biology, and even as it flourishes at the interface of these subjects, it holds a strong position within the two traditional disciplines. Fundamentally, biochemistry seeks to establish an understanding of biological phenomena at a molecular level.
Requirements for the Concentration:
The biochemistry concentration requirements reflect the fundamental importance of the intel- lectual tools and structures of biology and chemistry to the study of all issues in biochemistry, and we ask students to get a grounding in both disciplines. It is likely that many students enrolling in the concentration will major in either biology or chemistry. To encourage breadth within the concentration, no more than five six-credit courses from a student's own major may be counted toward the minimum requirements of the concentration.
Both the biology and chemistry departments maintain vigorous weekly seminar programs, regularly bringing to the college distinguished scientists, including many biochemists. Each concentrator should make it a priority to attend relevant seminars whenever possible. At the beginning of each term, concentrators will be notified of the pertinent biology and chemistry seminars held that term.

 Finally, both the chemistry and biology departments regularly offer integrative exercise experiences in biochemistry as an option for their majors. Concentrators who are biology or chemistry majors have the option of furthering their pursuit of biochemistry through a bio- chemical topic as the basis for their senior integrative exercise.

ment, evolution, and ecological interactions. Biologists pursue courses in teaching at the college or high school level, biological research, study in the medical sciences, work in environmental sciences, or work in numerous commercial and industrial areas. This program of study will also serve students interested in biology for purposes of general education.
Requirements for a Major:
Nine courses are required within the department.
1. Biology 123 and 124 in sequence (majors are required to complete Biology 123 and 124,
with a grade of "C-" or better before taking any other courses in the department)
2. One course from each of the following groups including their laboratories where listed sepa-
rately:
a. Organismal/Physiological (Biology 232, 234, 236, 238, 245, 250, 330, 359/360, 386) b. Evolution/Ecology (Biology 252/3, 350, 352/3, 356/357, 361/2)
c. Genetics/Development (Biology 240/1, 340, 342/3, 344/5)
d. Cell/Molecular (Biology 280/1, 310/311, 380/1, 382/3, 384)
3. Two electives, which may include a six-credit independent study, a junior/senior seminar, Biology 212, or any of the courses listed above
4. One course must emphasize data interpretation and analysis of the primary literature. Courses that fulfill this include Biology 340, 344, 361/2, 384, and all junior/senior seminars (All courses numbered fron Biology 365 through 379-)
5. Integrative Exercise (Biology 400 two terms).
Laboratory work is an integral part of most biology courses. In courses in which registration for the laboratory is separable from the lecture portion of the course, all biology majors are required to register concurrently for laboratory and lecture in order for these courses to count toward requirements for the major. No course taken at another school may be used to meet the require- ments for the major without prior approval of the Biology faculty.
Because of the close interrelationship of Biology to other sciences, supporting work in other areas is necessary. The minimum requirement includes (1) Physics 112; or Physics 113 and 115; or Physics 114 and 115; or Physics 126; or Mathematics 215; and (2) Chemistry 123 or 128; and (3) Chemistry 230 or 233/234. The need for additional courses in allied sciences and mathe- matics will vary with the professional plans of the student.

Chemistry provides the connection between molecular concepts and the complex systems found in nature. Chemistry courses stress the understanding of chemical principles, as well as the experimental basis of the science. The curriculum provides a strong foundation for graduate work in chemistry or biochemistry, for positions in industry, for high school teaching, and for studies in the medical sciences. The department is on the list of those approved by the American Chemical Society. For A.C.S. certification students must complete work in chemistry listed under the Professional Requirements section of this catalog.
All students planning to take Chemistry 122, 123, or 128 should use the Chemistry Placement Evaluation to determine which course to take. The placement evaluation can be found under the Chemistry Department home page at the Carleton College website. Prospective chemistry majors should begin their study of mathematics, physics and chemistry in the first year. Students who intend to enter graduate work in chemistry should realize that some pro- grams leading to a Ph.D. require reading knowledge of a foreign language; German, French, Russian and Japanese are the most valuable.
Majors are encouraged to participate in summer or fall term scientific research programs off campus or in the Chemistry Department Summer Research Program at Carleton.
Requirements for a Major:
Chemistry 123 or 128, 230, 233, 234, 304, 305, 343, 344; one of the following: 320, 328, 350, 351, 353, 354, 356, 365, 370; and one of the following lab courses: 306 (strongly recom- mended), 329, 352, 355, 357; Physics 113 and 115 or 114 and 115; and Mathematics 211. A second physics course, Physics 126, 128 or 235, is strongly recommended. Chemistry 400 is required of all majors.
Major under Combined Plan in Engineering (see also Engineering in index):
In addition to completing the requirements for the chemistry major listed above, the student should also take the following courses required for admission to the engineering schools: Physics 126 or 128, Mathematics 241, and Computer Science 117. At the discretion of the department, one advanced course may be waived in some instances to allow the student more latitude in selection of courses.

 Chemistry Courses
113. Concepts of Chemistry A one term chem- istry course designed for non-science majors. In this course, we examine what gives rise to the three dimensional shapes of molecules and we explore how the structure and composition of molecules effect chemical reactivity. Our goal is to understand readily observable phe- nomena (such as the removal of grease by soap, the storage of toxins and drugs in fat tis- sues, cancer, and viruses) on the molecular level. Topics also include those which address anthropogenic forces on the global environ- ment such as acid rain, nuclear energy, and depletion of the ozone layer. The course includes one four-hour laboratory per week. 6 credits, MS, Winter - M. Cass
122. An Introduction to Chemistry An introduc- tion to the fundamentals of chemistry to pre- pare students to enter subsequent chemistry courses (Chemistry 123 or 128). Atoms and molecules, stoichiometry, gases, and some thermochemistry will be covered in the course. Although learning through discovery- based processes, small groups, and short labo- ratory experimentation will occur, the course is not a lab course and therefore does not ful- fill the math/science distribution or require- ments for medical school. This course assumes competence with simple algebra, but no prior chemistry experience. Students with high school chemistry should probably take 123 (determined by the self-administered Chemistry Placement Evaluation, Chemistry Home Page). 6 credits, ND, Fall - M. Cass
123. Principles of Chemistry An introduction to chemistry for students who have taken high school chemistry or Chemistry 122. Topics include the electronic structure of atoms, peri- odicity, molecular geometry, thermodynamics, bonding, equilibrium, reaction kinetics and acids and bases. Substantial independent proj-
ect work is included in the lab. Each offering will also focus on a special topic(s) selected by the instructor. Students cannot receive credit for both Chemistry 123 and 128.

Requirements for a Major:
The Department of Classical Languages offers four majors:
Major in Classical Studies: This major is intended for students who want a broad introduction
to classical civilization. Students anticipating further work in classics should supplement the requirements of this major with more courses in the ancient languages. Requirements: 30 cred- its of work in Greek and/or Latin, including at least 24 credits of language work beyond the
102 level; 36 additional credits in the general area of classical civilization, including Classics 110 and one Greek and one Roman history course. Further courses in the languages may be included in this group. Students must choose a particular focus within the general area of classi- cal civilization and shape their program around it. Normally this will involve a concentration on either Greek or Roman civilization with work in the appropriate language. Students must regis- ter for six credits of Integrative Exercise during their senior year.
Major in Greek: This major is intended for students who want a thorough introduction to the language and literature of Greece; students who intend to go on to graduate work in classics will need to take more work in Latin than this major requires. Requirements: 36 credits in Greek beyond Greek 102. In addition, students must take 30 additional credits in the general area of classical civilization including Classics 110 and Greek History. Further courses in Greek beyond 102 or Latin at any level may count toward this requirement. Students must also regis- ter for six credits of Integrative Exercise during their senior year.
Major in Latin: This major is intended for students who want a thorough introduction to the
CLASSICAL LANGUAGES 63

 64 CLASSICAL LANGUAGES
language and literature of Rome; students who intend to do graduate work in classics will need to take more work in Greek than this major requires. Requirements: 36 credits in Latin beyond Latin 102. In addition, students must take 30 additional credits in the general area of classical civilization including Classics 110 and Roman history. Further courses in Latin beyond 102 and Greek at any level may count toward this requirement. Students must also register for six cred- its of Integrative Exercise during their senior year.
Major in Classical Languages: This major is intended for students who plan to pursue graduate work in classics or who want a thorough introduction to the language and literature of both Greece and Rome. Requirements: 30 credits in Latin beyond Latin 102, plus 24 credits in Greek beyond Greek 102; or 30 credits in Greek beyond Greek 102, plus 24 credits in Latin beyond Latin 102. In addition, students must take the following in-translation courses: Classics 110 and one course dealing with Greek or Roman history, depending on the language empha- sized. All students must register for a total of six credits of Integrative Exercise during their senior year.
The College language requirement may be satisfied by completion with a grade of at least C- in any of the Greek or Latin languages numbered 204 or above.
The Classics Departments of Carleton College and St. Olaf College cooperate in a program under which students of either college may elect certain courses on the other campus. This option is especially appropriate for upper level language courses not offered at Carleton. Carleton students should register for St. Olaf courses through the inter-registration process.
The Concentration in Archaeology will interest many students who are attracted to ancient civilization.
Certificate of Advanced Study in Foreign Language and Literature or Foreign Language and Area Studies: In order to receive the Certificate of Advanced Study in Classical Languages students must fulfill the general requirements (refer to Academic Regulations) in the following course distribution: six courses, of which at least three will be in the target language at the 200 level or above. Courses remaining may be from the Classics department or from a list of approved courses offered by other departments (philosophy, art, history, political science, etc.)
Classics Courses (CLAS)
(These courses do not presume knowledge of Greek or Latin)
100. Alexander the Great: From Man into Myth Alexander's conquest of much of his known world and beyond resulted in a range of mythologies that continue to surround the man. He has been viewed variously by differ- ent cultures as ambitious leader, philosopher, holy king, prophet, devil, or even god. The course examines a variety of writings, both ancient and modern, in an attempt to extract the facts from the fiction. This will provide a foundation for assessing how such mytholo- gies began to surround Alexander and why it
is that they have been perpetuated. 6 credits, S/CR/NC, AL, Fall - K. Cheshire
110. Introduction to Classical Studies This course will examine in depth the two most content-rich focal points of Classical antiq- uity-Periclean Athens and Early Imperial Rome-since they provide a context for so much of what Classics is about and, just as important, what different ages have imagined antiquity to be about. The course will cover Athens and Rome in roughly equal units, pro- viding different perspectives on the material from the variety of approaches that currently make up the study of the Classics: history,

 archaeology, anthropology, gender studies, lit- erary criticism, philology, religious studies, etc. 6 credits, HU, Fall - C. Hardy, C. Zimmerman
111. Classical Mythology: The Language of Myth
We will study a selection of the most famous Greek myths through close reading of Homer, Greek tragedy, and other ancient sources, and discuss the most prominent of ancient and modern modes of myth interpretation, in an attempt to determine how myth speaks - both to the ancient audiences and to us. 6 credits, AL, Spring - K. Cheshire
112. The Epic in Classical Antiquity An introduc- tion to the genre of epic poetry from Classical Antiquity. Students will read in translation examples from the Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman traditions in order to trace the devel- opment of the major features and themes of this genre and to understand the considerable influence this genre has exerted both during antiquity and thereafter. Authors will include Homer, Apollonius, Virgil, .and Lucan. No prerequisites. 6 credits, AL, Winter - C. Zimmerman
114. Gender and Sexuality in Classical Antiquity Cross-listed with WGST 114. In both ancient Greece and Rome, gender (along with class and citizenship status) largely determined what people did, where they spent their time, and how they related to others. This course will examine the ways in which Greek and Roman societies defined gender categories, and how they used them to think about larger social, political, and religious issues. Readings from epic, lyric, and drama, as well as ancient historical, philosophical, and medical writers. No prerequisites. 6 credits, HU, Winter - C. Hardy
116. Ancient Drama: Truth in Performance Cross- listed with THEA 116. The tragic and comic stage offered the Greeks and Romans a public arena for addressing in an engaging way such fundamental topics as love, family, justice, and the divine. Although the written word has fortunately preserved for us many ancient plays, the proper media for their communica- tion remains, as their authors intended, the stage, the voice, and the body. This course
will therefore address a variety of ancient tragedies and comedies with special attention, not only to their themes, but to the manner of their staging and performance. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
117. Archaeology of Greece The course will concentrate on the Prehistoric Period in Greece, from the first arrival of man to the end of the Bronze Age. A major emphasis will be placed on the Minoan and Mycenaean Periods in Crete and Greece respectively. Along with the study of the culture of this period, the course will include a study of archaeological technique, so that the archaeo- logical evidence can be evaluated. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
125. Love, Death and Destiny: The Ancient Novel
The novel is an unfamiliar but delightful area of Greek and Roman literature, with its hey- day in the Roman empire of the second cen- tury A.D. We will study most of the nine Greek ones, which are romantic short novels about ill-fated lovers and their wild, world- wide adventures. We will also read the two Latin ones, Petronius' Satyricon and Apuleius* Metamorphoses, or Golden Ass, which are rich both in satire and an important spiritual dimension. N o prerequisites. Read in English. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.

227. Greek History: The Greek World From the Rise of the City-State to the Rise of the
Hellenistic Kingdoms Cross-listed with HIST
201. A survey of the civilization of the ancient Greeks, emphasizing the evolution of the city- state as a cohesive social, political, and eco- nomic organism. The development of the city-state as a response to the physical envi- ronment of Greece will form a component of this study, as will a discussion of the historical method: how do we use the few surviving archaeological remains and little written evi- dence to reconstruct the history of these peo- ple and their institutions? The period covered in depth will run from the beginning of the city-state ca. 750 B.C. to the conquests of Alexander the Great (336-323 B.C.) and the legacy of international monarchies that fol- lowed. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
228. Roman History, Republic and Principate Cross-listed with HIST 202. Introduction to the basic facts of political history from the Etruscan period to the early third century A.D.

229. The Later Roman Empire, Byzantium and Islam Cross-listed with HIST 203. Introduction to the basic facts of political history of the Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic empires from the third to the ninth centuries A.D. Readings and discussion of primary texts from the points of view of social, intellectual, and particularly religious history. Some attention to art and architecture; individual projects of research and interpretation. An important goal is to understand the phenomena of Christianity and Islam in their native context, the Mediterranean world of late antiquity. May be counted toward the History major. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.

COGNITIVE STUDIES CONCENTRATION
COGNITIVE STUDIES CONCENTRATION (CGST)
Coordinator Professor Kathleen M. Galotti
Cognitive studies examines different approaches to questions concerning the nature of mind, the representation of knowledge, the acquisition, comprehension, and production of language, the development of learning and intelligence, and the assessment of "goodness of fit" between pur- portedly similar systems (e.g., the computer and the mind). Exploration of some or all of these questions has been and is being undertaken in such disciplines as cognitive psychology, linguis- tics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, animal cognition, social cognition and oth- ers. The concentration in cognitive studies therefore represents a formal means of bringing together students and faculty in different disciplines who share common interests. We seek to enrich the view provided by any one discipline through an exploration of the contributions of others.
The concentration is designed for students majoring in psychology, philosophy, computer science or linguistics (as a special major), although all students are welcome.
Requirements for the Concentration:
To encourage breadth within the concentration, no more than four courses taken from a single department (or four Cognitive Studies courses cross-listed in a single department) may be counted toward the minimum eight required.
Core Courses: Students must take four courses (24 credits)

CROSS-CULTURAL STUDIES CONCENTRATION (CCST)
Coordinator: Professor Clifford Clark Associate Coordinator: Professor James Fisher
Committee Members: Scott Carpenter, Clifford Clark, Michael Hemesath, Roger Jackson, Che*rif Kei'ta, Jerome Levi, Kathryn Sparling, Qiguang Zhao
This concentration has been created for American and international students interested in trav- eling and working abroad. It is designed to help students who are studying a particular area of the world (e.g., majors in area studies, languages, history, economics, political science, litera- ture, anthropology, religion, etc.) to place that area in a broader, comparative, cross-cultural con- text by seeing how it participates in and is influenced by trans-national, sometimes global, dynamics and problems. It is also designed to attract international students, no matter what

CROSS-CULTURAL STUDIES CONCENTRATION
their major, who in coming to Carleton will experience a culture not their own, normally in a language not their own, and thereby have at least an experiential basis for comparative study.
The objectives of this concentration are: 1) by making comparisons explicit, to enable stu- dents to come to a sharper understanding not only of their own society but also of a society dif- ferent from their own; 2) to bring together American and international students in a program of study and interaction that will prepare them to live and work productively in an unfamiliar area of the world; 3) to provide a forum for studying problems and issues that cut across traditional national or cultural boundaries, such as citizenship, ethnicity, linguistic grouping, etc. that tend to be excluded in traditional disciplines or area studies; and 4) to create an arena for faculty whose work focuses on different parts of the world to address common issues and problems in a comparative, collaborative framework.
Requirements for the Concentration:
First-year students interested in this program should enroll in the First-Year Seminar, Cross- Cultural Studies 100, Growing Up Cross-Culturally.
To fulfill the requirements for this concentration, each concentrator must look at his/her area from three different perspectives: 1) in focused comparison with another culture, 2) in regional perspective, broadening the focus beyond national or conventional borders, 3) globally, in rela- tion to some issue or problem affecting the future.
Language is fundamental to understanding other societies and therefore to the concentration. Each concentrator will have, at a minimum, completed the Carleton language requirement (or the equivalent) in the language of his or her focus area. Upper level language study is also encouraged.
Concentrators will normally take the First-Year Seminar (recommended but not required), the Sophomore Theory course (CCST 200), four courses at the 200 level or higher selected from three groupings (regional courses which transcend national boundaries, comparative courses, and global issues courses from the pertinent courses list), a colloquium for students returning from off-campus study (CCST 175), and a senior seminar (either CCST 395 or HIST 395). American students will also participate in an approved international program (one term or full year), nor- mally in an area where the language studied at Carleton by the student is spoken. (International students are exempt from this requirement since they already participated in a foreign culture).

 Cross-Cultural Studies Courses
100. Growing Up Cross-Culturally From cradle to grave, cultural assumptions shape our own sense of who we are. This course is designed to enable American and international students to compare how their own and other societies view birth, infancy, adolescence, marriage, adulthood, and old age. Using children's books, child-rearing manuals, movies, and ethnographies, we will explore some of the assumptions in different parts of the globe about what it means to "grow up." 6 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, RAD, Fall-C. Clark, J. Fisher, M. Hemesath, £. P6sfay
175.1 Am A Stranger Here Myself Designed for students who are returning from off-campus studies or who have lived abroad, and for any- one who has had the experience of being an outsider, this course will explore theories and models of intercultural competence and inter- cultural transition. Using the actual experi- ence of the students in class as its evidence, it will first develop theories about the nature of intercultural contact and then test their use- fulness by applying them to the analysis of specific historical and literary evidence. 6 cred- its, ND, RAD, Winter - P. Crosby, M.
Johnson, £. P6sfay
200. Theory and Practice of Cross-Cultural Study This course introduces students to theoretical, epistemological, and methodological issues in cross-cultural study. Emphasis will be on cul- tural translation, cultural encounters between groups, and the concomitant cultural appro- priations, cross-fertilizations, and resistance. How do we define and understand "communi- ties" and "cultures"? What are the dynamics of power involved in cultural encounters? What are the theoretical debates surrounding colonialism and post-colonialism, globaliza- tion, and transnationalism? How do we juxta- pose regional cultural identities vis-a-vis
globalization and transnationalism? The
course will examine approaches drawn from
the humanities and social sciences, and apply them to case studies from different parts of
the world. 6 credits, ND, Spring - K. Sparling, B. Nagel

STUDIES IN DANCE (DANC)
Professor: Mary Easter
Assistant Professor Judith Nelson
Adjunct Instructors: Jennifer A. Bader, Jane Shockley
Dance activities are designed to give students of all levels opportunities for active participation in three basic areas: technique, choreography and analysis, and performance. The broadest goal of these offerings is to increase understanding of the art of dance as a contribution to a liberal arts education. Among more specific goals are the development of a trained, articulate body, increased choreographic skill and more finely-honed performance. Though there is no major program, dance activities take place in an appreciative atmosphere marked by high enthusiasm for the art.
Technique Classes
Classes in Modern Dance Technique and Ballet are offered on at least two levels during all terms. Other technique classes offered yearly are jazz, tap, moving anatomy and con- tact improvisation. All courses may be taken any number of terms at the appropriate level. A maximum of 24 credits from dance tech- nique classes may be counted toward gradua- tion.
Beginning Level Courses offered for physi- cal education credit only, see Physical Education, Athletics and Recreation for regis- tration information and course descriptions:
Ballet I (PE 107)

EAST ASIAN STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Coordinator: Professor Mariko Kaga
East Asia consists of areas encompassed by present day China, Japan, and Korea (and sometimes also Mongolia and Siberia). This concentration will consist of a program of study combining language training, required courses in history, supporting courses in humanities and social sci- ences and an interdisciplinary senior seminar. The underlying logic of this program will high- light both the similarities and differences in the society of this area and generate increased understanding of a non-Western experience.
Requirements for the Concentration:
The East Asian Studies Concentration requires completion of two core courses, one year of either Chinese or Japanese language, four supporting courses (from at least two different departments) and an advanced paper. Courses completed as part of ACP, AKP, or a Carleton or ACM/GLCA program may apply to concentration requirements. Students wishing to enroll in this concentra- tion should normally be majors in Asian language, economics, history, political science, religion, or sociology and anthropology.

Economics analyses the ways in which resources can be most effectively organized to meet the changing goals of a society. Courses in the department combine theoretical and applied econom- ics as a basis for developing and evaluating alternative public policies for entire economies and for the institutions and organizations within an economy. Department courses give a broad and practical perspective for those considering careers in law, government, business, education, jour- nalism or social service, and also meet the needs of students seeking graduate work in econom- ics, business administration, and public affairs. The basic introductory courses, 110 and 111, are prerequisites to most advanced courses and while they offer a good foundation for further work in economics, they have also been designed for those students who have not yet selected majors and for those in other majors seeking an introduction to the analysis of economic theory and policies. Note: Either course in the principles sequence, Economics 110 or 111, can be taken first. Independent study (291 or 391) for those with special research interests can be taken with any faculty member.

Requirements for a Major:
All economics majors are required to successfully complete the two introductory courses (110 and 111), the three core courses (330, 331, and 332), the integrative exercise (400), and 30 additional credits in economics at the 200 level or above. Math 215 (or 315) is a prerequisite for 332 and is also required.
Mathematics 111 or its equivalent is a prerequisite for Economics 330. Any student intend- ing graduate work in economics should also take Mathematics 121, 211, and 232. Courses teaching additional skills such as computer science, advanced rhetoric, and analysis of political and social policies are highly recommended. Internships may not count towards the major unless expressly permitted by the Chair.

Prerequisite: Economics 260. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
262. The Economics of Sports In recent years,
the sports business in the United States has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. Understanding the sports business from an economic viewpoint is the subject of this' course. Topics will include player compensa- tion, revenue-sharing, salary caps, free agency, tournaments, salary discrimination, profes- sional franchise valuation, league competitive- ness, college athletics, and the economics of sports stadiums and arenas. 6 credits, SS, Fall Ñ M. Kanazawa
265. Game Theory and Economic Applications
The opportunity for strategic behavior exists not only in games like monopoly, poker, or tennis; negotiations of wage contracts, work habits of individuals in study groups, and output decisions of cartel members are also examples. Game theory is the study of pur- poseful behavior in strategic circumstances. In the last twenty years economic analysis has been transformed by developments in and applications of game theory. Many of the results are counter-intuitive or anomalous. In this class modern game theoretic tools will be derived and applied to a wide variety of eco- nomic issues. These include the effect of patents on product variety, cartel behavior, efficient tort law, corporate take-overs, and the credibility of the Fed. Prerequisite: Mathematics 1 1 1 . 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
270. Economics of the Public Sector A theoreti- cal and empirical examination of the govern- ment's role in the U.S. economy. Emphasis will be put on policy analysis using both the criteria of efficiency and equity. Topics treated include rationales for government interven- tion; analysis of alternative public expenditure programs from a partial and/or general equi- librium framework; the incidence of various types of taxes; models of collective choice; cost-benefit analysis; intergovernmental fiscal relations. 6 credits, SS, Winter - N. Grawe
271. Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment Cross-listed with ENTS 211. This course focuses on environmental economics, energy economics, and on the relationship between them. Economic incentives for pollu- tion abatement, the industrial organization of energy production, optimal depletion rates of energy sources, and the environmental and economic consequences of alternate energy

 sources will be analyzed. Prerequisite: Economics 1 1 1 . 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
273. Water and Western Economic Development
Cross-listed with ENTS 273. This course will examine a number of important aspects of water as a legal/political/economic factor in the development of the western United States. The topics will include western water law, the evolution of water supply institutions, state and local water planning, the role of the fed- eral government, and a number of current water problems, including surface and groundwater pollution, impediments to mar- ket transfers of water, and state/regional/inter- national conflicts over water. Prerequisite: Economics 1 1 1 . 6 credits, SS, Spring Ñ M. Kanazawa
274. Labor Economics What do you want from work? What do employers want from you? The hurly-burly of the international market- place creates problems-and opportunities-for employers and employees. This course uses economic theory to analyze the market for labor and focuses on such diverse issues as leveraged buyouts, fringe benefits, salaries of athletes, financing of education, unions and collective bargaining, unemployment insur- ance, workers' compensation, discrimination and harassment, minimum wage policies, wel- fare, and income distribution. 6 credits, SS, Fall Ñ N. Grawe
275. Law and Economics Legal rules and insti- tutions influence people's behavior. By setting acceptable levels of pollution, structuring guidelines for contract negotiations, deciding who should pay for the costs of an accident, and determining punishment for crimes, courts, and legislatures create incentives. How do economic considerations factor into legal rules, and how do laws affect economic output
and distribution? In this class, we use court cases, experiments, and current legal contro- versies to explore such issues. 6 credits, SS, Winter-J. Wahl
277. Public Interest in Private Economic Behavior An introduction to the public regulation of private economic activity. Economic argu- ments for regulation and antitrust legislation based on natural monopoly, information fail- ure, and externality considerations will be dis- cussed. Alternative regulatory policies, such as licensing, rate of return regulation, standards, and taxes, will be analyzed in terms of their efficacy in correcting market failure and their impact on income distribution, 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
278. Industrial Organization and Pricing Policy The firm's marketing and pricing problems,
its conduct, and the resulting economic per- formance, given the nature of the demand for its produces), its buying markets, the nature
of its unit costs, and the structure of its sell- ing market(s). 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
279. Urban Economics This course analyzes the growth and development of metropolitan areas with emphasis on the spatial distribu- tion of population and employment within those areas. Urban problems and associated policy issues concerning transportation, con- gestion, pollution, poverty, race, housing, governmental structure and the fiscal crisis of local governments are examined. 6 credits, SS, Spring Ñ D. Gibbons

400. Integrative Exercise 6 credits, S/NC, ND,
Guided by the assumption that an understanding of educational values, policies, and practices is a legitimate and important part of liberal arts studies, Carleton offers a program of courses which, with the exception of student teaching, are open to all students and can be counted toward meeting distribution requirements in social sciences. No major is offered; however, we do offer an interdisciplinary concentration for those students who are especially interested in educational studies but not necessarily in public school teaching.
Students may qualify for a secondary (grades 5-12) teaching license in the State of Minnesota in the following areas: communication arts, (English), mathematics, modern languages (French, German, Russian, Spanish), earth, life and physical sciences, social studies,and visual arts. In the elementary field, preparation at Carleton is limited to the teaching of art. Earning licensure requires: completion of an approved Carleton major; other subject area courses not required by the Carleton major and/or specific courses within the major, a specified program of educational studies courses (see the Teacher Education Handbook), and student teaching in the major field in a "13th Term."
Students interested in obtaining teaching licensure should obtain a handbook from the department office which provides detailed information, and should consult with a member of

 EDUCATIONAL STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Coordinator: Professor John G. Ramsay
The Educational Studies Concentration provides an interdisciplinary approach to the study of education as an individual pursuit, an institutional venture, and a societal problem. The concen- tration aims to develop thoughtful, skillful and imaginative students of the psychology, cultural history, and politics of education.

100. Ways of Seeing What does it mean to "see" the world in a particular way? What are the factors that create, shape and limit our visions? This class will explore how works of poetry, fiction and drama represent the visions of authors and characters, and we will practice the skills of close critical reading and writing in order to articulate our own "ways of see- ing." The texts we study will engage different historical periods, national contexts, and racial and gendered identities, and we will discover our own interpretations of the world through a careful examination of literary craft and technique. 6 credits, S/CR/NC, AL, Fall-N. Cho
100. Harpies, Shrews and Whores: Advocates of Women's Rights from Mary Astell to Virginia Woolf In this course we will examine the fierce debates surrounding the position of women from the late seventeenth until the early twentieth century.

Radicals like Mary Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller, on the other hand, advocated a redistribution of power in society based on the ideals of the American and French revolu- tions, whilst J.S. Mill advocated a society of untrammeled competition in which women would be able to find their natural social niche. Finally, we will look at Virginia Woolfs work which will set the terms for

 most modern debates about feminism. 6 cred- its, S/CR/NC, AL, Fall -1. Italia

The course emphasizes cross-cultural influences of African American and Native American forms and themes. Students will practice close reading and listening and will write short papers on thematic, metaphorical, and historical rela- tionships. The ability to read music is not required. 6 credits, S/CR/NC, AL, Fall - L. Archhold, C.Oliver
100. Reading and Writing About Literature In
this course, we will explore a variety of liter- ary genres, including novels, short fiction, poetry, and drama, of various periods (from Early Modern to the twentieth century) and various national origins (including English, American, Irish, and Caribbean).

and Malory's Morte d'Arthur. Most readings will be in modern English translation, and a few will be in Middle English. 6 credits, AL, Spring Ñ C. Lines

230. African American Autobiography Cross- listed with AFAM 230 and AMST 230. The African American slave narrative chronicles remarkable transformations: how a (wo)man was made a slave and how a slave was made a (wo)man. The ex-slave's affirmation of self- hood found expression in first-person narra- tives that launched a literary tradition. We will place this emerging tradition in its his- torical context, discuss its defining character- istics, and trace its development in twentieth-century African American autobi- ography. Our definition of "the literary" will not be divorced from relevant cultural codes and historical context. We will read classic slave narratives by Equiano, Douglass, and Jacobs; and twentieth-century autobiography by Washington, Hurston, Wright, Malcolm X, Angelou, Brooks, and Njeri. Group IV. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.

235. Asian American Literature Cross-listed with AMST 235. This course is an introduction to major works and authors of fiction, non-fic- tion, drama, and poetry from about 1900 to the present. Though contemporary writers such as Amy Tan and Maxine Hong Kingston have brought Asian American literature to popular attention, these accomplishments are part of a rich tradition of Asian American
ENGLISH 93

writing that dates back to the turn of the cen- tury. In this course we will pay particular attention to the historical, social, and political contexts of the works we read, in order to explore how diverse Asian American literary traditions have developed. Group IV. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
236. American Nature Writing Cross-listed with AMST 23 7 and ENTS 236. A study of the environmental imagination in American liter- ature.

Students will write a creative Natural History essay as part of the course requirements. 6 credits, AL, Fall - M. Kowalewski
237. American Indian Literature Cross-listed with AMST 238 and ENTS 237. We will begin by examining what one critic has called the Image and Anti-Image of Indians in American literature. Then, by studying both ancient
oral traditions, nineteenth-century oratory, early autobiographies, and more recent Indian fiction and poetry, we will seek to understand the complexities of Indian tribal identity and ecological perception, intercultural communi- cation, and the bicultural inheritance modern Native American writers bring to their work. Group IV. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
240. Directing Refer to THEA 240 for descrip- tion. 6 credits, ND, Fall - R. Weiner

study of a selection of important American plays from Eugene O'Neill's Hairy Ape (1920) to Tony Kushner s Angels in America (1992) in the context of larger American themes and cultural preoccupations. The premise of this course is that these plays define the American theatre for most of this century. By studying them we will gain understanding of our own culture and the links that connect this culture to the transformative events of the century. Group IV. 6 credits, AL, Winter - R. Weiner
243. Classic Theater: Aeschylus to Shakespeare
Cross-listed with THEA 243- The study of dra- matic literature in historical context, focusing not only on the plays but on the spaces, con- ditions, and conventions of theatrical perform- ance from the ancient Greeks to Shakespeare.

260. Introduction to Creative Writing This course offers blocks of intensive training in poetry, prose fiction, and what has recently been termed "creative non-fiction." The pri- mary objective is to come to an understanding of the varying and at times overlapping capa- bilities of these three genres and to produce works in each. Discussion of each participant's writing is the central mode of instruction. This will be supplemented by examples from published writers and some theoretical essays on the creative process. 6 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, Not offered in 2001-2002.
270. The Crafts of Writing: The Short Story A n
introduction to the writing of the short story. Each student will write and have discussed in class three stories (from 1,500 to 4,000 words in length) and give constructive suggestions about the stories written by other members of the class. Students are expected to write brief critiques of each story written by their class- mates. Prerequisite: writing requirement. 6 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, Fall - G. Smith
271. The Crafts of Writing: Poetry This course concerns itself with the development of poetic vision as much as craft. Through intensive writing and revision of poetry, supplemented by reading and discussion of contemporary
poetry and poetics, each member of the group will form a body of work and a statement that stakes a poetic claim. The objective is to begin to discover how each of us fits or does not fit into the modern poetical tradition and the diverse contemporary poetry scene, so as to free us from solipsism and vague notions of the powers of poetry. 6 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, Not offered in 2001-2002.
273. Ireland Program: Ireland in Context: Writing Across Cultures This course concerns the extra- literary experience of Ireland: encountering
the Irish people, the Irish present and past, Irish cities and villages, Irish music, painting, sculpture, and food, whatever becomes avail- able to us of Irish culture, and writing about the experience in a journal leading to a final paper. 4 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, Summer 2001 - F. Morral
275. The Crafts of Writing: The Essay This course is designed for students who wish to write better papers and want to extend their range of forms, styles, and techniques. It will be particularly valuable for those thinking about writing comps papers. We will examine and attempt essays of various kinds, focusing on style, structure, and argument. Prerequisite: writing requirement. 6 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, Not offered in 2001-2002.

English or American Literature. See "General Information" above.
300. Chaucer I: Canterbury Tales We will read a selection of the poetic texts of the Canterbury Tales in Middle English (no previous knowl- edge assumed), paying particular attention to the interaction between pilgrims and genres. Group I. 6 credits, AL, Winter Ñ C. Lines
303. Studies in Medieval Literature: Dante The Divine Comedy is perhaps the supreme literary masterpiece of the Middle Ages, and it is one of the most influential poems for literature in English from Chaucer right through to the present day. We will read all three books of the Divine Comedy considering it in its histori- cal context and examining some recent criti- cism of the poem. We will also spend some time looking at how various authors incorpo- rate Dante into their own work. All texts are in translation. This course will fulfill the English departments literature in translation requirement or Group I. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
305. Friendship, Love and Marriage in the Middle Ages If we were asked to name some- thing truly universal, many of us would say "love." Yet love and other intimate relations are immensely variable across time and cul- tures. This course will explore the meanings and functions of friendship, same-sex and cross-sex love, and marriage in medieval liter- ature. We will consider issues such as gender roles, class, religion, and medieval ideas of sexuality, to name a few. Willingness to think critically and to question our cultural freight of received ideas is a must. Our readings will be drawn from many genres and will also include modern critical and theoretical works. Group I. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
308. English Renaissance Verse A study of the remarkable range of verses written by men and women of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in response to their turbulent times. We will trace the development of different genres and will attend to some of the major debates in which this verse is engagedÑ debates over the nature and purpose of poetry, the relationship between man and woman, and that between humanity and God. Our emphasis will be on lyric poetry, including the love sonnets of the 1590s, and the so- called "metaphysical" poetry of Donne, Herbert, and Marvell. Group I. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
310. Shakespeare: The Histories and Comedies A study of Shakespeare's Lancastrien Tetralogy and of his comedies of the 1590's. Group I. 6 credits, AL, Fall Ñ Jm. McDonnell

330. Literature of the American West Cross-listed with AMST 330 and ENTS 330. Wallace Stegner once described the West as "the geog- raphy of hope" in the American imagination.
Despite various dystopian urban pressures, the region still conjures up images of wide vistas and sunburned optimism. We will explore
this paradox by examining both popular
mythic conceptions of the West (primarily in film) and more searching literary treatments
of the same area. We will explore how writers such as Twain, Cather, Stegner, Castillo, and Cormac McCarthy have dealt with the geo- graphical diversity and multiethnic history of the West. Films will include The Searchers, The Ballad ofGregorio Cortez, Unforgiven, and Lone Star. Group TV. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
331. Banned and Burned: Controversial Texts in American Literature and Culture Cross-listed with AMST 331. This course takes an interdiscipli- nary approach to some famous (and some not- so-famous) controversies involving texts published in the United States in the nine- teenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics to be addressed include literacy and access to print, politics and propaganda, gender and sexuality, censorship, and the impact of new media on the dissemination of controversial texts. Through readings and discussions of books by Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, J. D. Salinger, and Allen Ginsberg, students will gain an understanding of how social, political, and cultural values are challenged, modified, and transformed through the act of publica- tion. 6 credits, AL, Fall - S. Wadswortb
332. Studies in American Literature: Faulkner Hemingway, and Fitzgerald Cross-listed with AMST 332. An intensive study of the novels and short fiction of William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and F.

333. Studies in Nineteenth-Century American Literature: Writing in the 1850s Cross-listed with AMST 323. This course introduces students
to the History of the Book as a field of study by focusing on American literary culture dur- ing the 1850s: a decade of perhaps unmatched literary achievement in U.S. history. Tracing the emergence of modern authorship and pub- lishing, we will examine the parallel courses of popular and belletristic writing at the height of the American Renaissance. Readings include texts by canonical authors such as Hawthorne, Melville, Thoreau, and Whitman, along with the first national "bestsellers" and selections from popular genres traditionally regarded as ephemeral. Group III. 6 credits, AL, Spring - S. Wadswortb
334. Studies in American Literature: The Postmodern American Novel Cross-listed with AMST 334. Is there such a thing as Postmodernism? And if there is, how do we define it? What sets Postmodern literature apart from the literature of the first half of the twentieth century? Or is Postmodernism merely a deviant branch of Modernism? We will try to answer these questions, first by using a classic Modernist text (let's say, Hemingway), to define Modernism, and then by reading a number of authors frequently referred to as Postmodern (Nabokov, Barth, Pynchon, Morrison, and others). Group IV 6 credits, AL, Winter Ñ G. Smith
335. Studies in Nineteenth-Century American Literature: American Realism Cross-listed with AMST 337. Between the American Renaissance and the flowering of modernism
lies a period of literature that has alternately frustrated and fascinated scholars. This course will explore American literary production between the Civil War and the early twenti- eth century, with a focus on the rich variety of writing often lumped together under the genre of "realism." Questions concerning the construction of American "culture" will be central to the course, and authors include Mark Twain, Henry James, Theodore Dreiser, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles Chestnutt, Edith Wharton, and others. Group III. 6 credits, AL, Winter -N. Cho
336. Studies in American Literature: Major American Authors: 1850-1920 Cross-listed with AMST 336. Reading and discussion of works by major American authors of the nineteenth century: Hawthorne's House ofthe Seven Gables, Melville's Moby Dick, Twain's Huckleberry Finn, James's Portrait ofa Lady, Wharton's House of Mirth, and the poetry of Dickinson and Frost. Group III. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
337. African American Novelists in Context
Cross-listed with AFAM 337 and AMST 333.
This course will discuss Baldwin, Hurston, Ellison, Charles Johnson, Paule Marshall, Morrison, Naylor, Wideman, and Wright as formal technicians and wordsmiths, and assess these writers' contributionÑindividually and collectivelyÑto the novelistic tradition in the twentieth century. We will read and discuss novels from the 1930s (Their Eyes were Watching God), 1940s (Native Son), 1950s (Invisible Man and Go Tell It On the Mountain),
1960s (The Chosen Place, The Timeless People), 1970s (Song ofSolomon), 1980s (Mama Day), and the 1990s (Middle Passage and Philadelphia Fire). Prerequisite: One of the following courses: ENGL/AFAM/AMST 117; ENGL/AMST 112, or with instructor's per-

 mission. Group IV. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
338. Rereading the African American Novel
Cross-listed with AFAM 339, AMST 339 and WGST 338. Commenting on the scant atten- tion accorded Brooks' Maud Martha and the overwhelming response of the academic com- munity to Ellison's Invisible Man, Mary Helen Washington notes that "the real 'invisi- ble man'...[is) the black woman." By granting high visibility to Nella Larsen, Zora Hurston, Toni Morrison, Gloria Naylor and Alice Walker, this course contributes to ongoing efforts to address and redress an imbalance in the criticism of the African-American novel. It will be suggested that Hurston, Morrison and Walker, in particular, extend the bound- aries of African-American literary expression through their daring experimentation with the language and form of fiction. Prerequisite: One of the following courses: English 112, 117, 230 or with instructor's permission. Group IV 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
339. Contemporary American Playwrights of Color Cross-listed with AMST 340 and THEA 339.

342. Early Modern Drama Cross-listed with
THEA 342. We will begin with a study of realism, as diversely practiced by such pio- neering dramatists as Ibsen, Strinberg,
Chekhov and Shaw, and trace its anti-realist dimension in Symbolism and Expressionism, then reactions against Realism represented by Pirandello and Brecht. We will examine plays not simply as objects of literary scrutiny but also as historical artifacts and scripts for con- temporary performance. There will be occa- sional video screenings and possible field trips to professional productions. Group IV or liter- ature in translation. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
343. Contemporary European and American
Drama Cross-listed with THEA 343. We will
begin with a study of the key developments in
r
post-W WII drama: Theater of the Absurd,
and the development of hard-hitting political drama in Britain. We will also see how ele- ments of the absurd and political intermingle in the more distinctly American social com- mentary of Shepard and Mamet. Finally, we will focus on recent works that interrogate, parody, or de-familiarize differences of race, gender, or sexual orientation. Our analysis of these works will be historical and performa- tive as well as literary, and may be aided by

Weiner
362. Narrative Theory Cross-listed with MEDA 362. "Does the world really present itself to perception in the form of well-made stories?" asks Hayden White (historiographer). To try to answer that question, we will read contem- porary narrative theory and analyze various literary texts and films. This course fulfills the advanced seminar requirement. Prerequisite: English 200. 6 credits, AL, Fall - S.Jaret McKinstry
370. Advanced Crafts of Writing: The Short Story An advanced course in the writing of fiction. Students are expected to write brief critiques of each story written by their classmates.

and profound influence on Romantic litera-
ture and thought, and will assess the impact
of that relationship upon modern critical thinking about the nature of literary influ-
ence. Readings will include works by Milton, Blake, Byron, and the Shelleys, including Prometheus Unbound and Frankenstein. 6 credits, AL, Winter - T. Raylor, C. Walker
395. The Pre-Raphaelites Henry James called the Pre-Raphaelites "people who look at the world and at life not directly...in all its acci- dental reality, but in the reflection and orna- mental portrait of it." We will study Pre-Raphaelite poetry and painting, examin- ing individual poems and their "illustrations" - such as Tennyson's "Lady of Shalott" - and setting these works in their broader Victorian aesthetic, literary and cultural contexts to understand the Pre-Raphaelites' contributions to our theories of aesthetics, poetics, and art consumption.

400. Integrative Exercise Senior English majors may fulfill the integrative exercise either by taking a comprehensive examination based on a departmental reading list, or by writing a senior thesis on a topic approved by the department. The topic must be convincingly defined before the end of fall term, a substan- tial portion must be written by the middle of winter term, and the final draft must be sub- mitted by the due date early in spring term. Those who choose the exam option should form groups to discuss the texts on the read- ing list. The six-hour exam will be given early in the spring term. No student may change

from the paper to the exam option later than the deadline established by the department (one week after the winter term portion is due). Students may register for the integrative
exercise according to their individual require- ments, the grade will be registered at the end of spring term. 6 credits, S/NC, ND, Winter, Spring Ñ S.Jaret McKinstry, R. Tisdale
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES CONCENTRATION (ENTS)
Coordinators: Professor Dale Jamieson, fall and spring, Professor Norman Vig, winter Professors: Norman Vig, Caryl Edward Buchwald, Mary Savina, Gary E. Wagenbach
An interdisciplinary concentration open to students in all majors. Concentrators must take the introductory course (ENTS 110) in their first or second year and are advised to work out their program in consultation with one of the coordinators before the end of their sophomore year. Students select one of three tracks within the concentration - Environmental Sciences, Natural History, or Science, Values and Policy - depending on their particular interests and background. All concentrators must register for the one-credit Ethics and Values Colloquium for three terms, preferably in the junior year, and must complete a senior colloquium project.
Requirements for the Concentration:
ENTS 110; 36 credits arranged with one of the track coordinators (see below); 3 credits of jun- ior colloquium; minimum of three credits of senior colloquium.
Tracks (students select one:)
Environmental Sciences
Coordinators: Mary Savina, Gary E. Wagenbach
This track is designed for science majors and other students with strong backgrounds in science and mathematics. In addition to exploring the links among science, policy, and human experi- ence, the Environmental Sciences track emphasizes how ideas and methods from more than one science interact and, indeed, are required to understand and resolve most environmental prob- lems. Consequently, faculty have committed themselves to exploring these cross-disciplinary connections in their intermediate and advanced science courses that concern the environment. Besides advanced proficiency in one or more relevant scientific disciplines, a concentrator achieves a detailed understanding of how the sciences intersect to analyze and mitigate environ- mental problems. Students need to consult with the track coordinator about their proposed pro- gram when they declare the concentration. Requirements: ENTS 110, three intermediate or higher-level science courses concerned with the environment; three ENTS cross-listed courses outside the natural sciences, including one from Arts and Literature or Humanities and one from the Social Sciences; junior colloquium (3 credits); senior colloquium project (3-6 credits).

 ENVIRONMENTAL AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES CONCENTRATION 103
Natural History
Coordinators: Caryl Ed Buchwald, Mary Savina
The Natural History track is designed primarily for science and humanities majors. It draws on the examples set by classic naturalists like Charles Darwin, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, and Rachel Carson and such living naturalists as Barry Lopez and Ann Zwinger - all of whom are liberally educated in natural science, philosophy, and literature; pursue knowledge as much in the field as in the library; maintain an integrative, synoptic style of thought; and seek to com- municate their ideas and discoveries to the widest possible audience. Skilled in observation and analysis, they are nevertheless concerned with all aspects of humanity's role on earth. Students in this track will be encouraged to develop similar breadth through a program that integrates knowledge, experience, and writing skills around some facet of nature or natural development. Students must get approval of their program from the track coordinator. Requirements: ENTS 110; a total of three courses in geology and biology with a field-oriented component; one course dealing significantly with evolution; one approved course in history, literature or humanities (note: for biology and geology majors, a total of three approved courses in history, literature, or humanities is required); one course in science, values and policy; junior colloquium (3 credits); senior colloquium (3 credits).
Society, Values and Policy
Coordinator: Norman Vig
This track is for students in any major, including those in the natural sciences (non-science majors may fulfill their science requirement through this track). Its purpose is to acquaint stu- dents with the scientific, technological, and humanistic bases of public policy and to develop analytical skills for addressing complex technical and social questions. While several of the courses focus on environmental issues, others involve more sociological and anthropological analysis of human development. Students in this track will be encouraged to put their skills to work in an internship or other practical experience. Students should consult with the track coor- dinator about their proposed program. Requirements: ENTS 110; three approved courses in society, values and policy; two natural science courses, including at least one dealing substan- tially with the environment; one approved course in Arts and Literature or Humanities; junior colloquium (3 credits); senior colloquium (3 credits).

FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Coordinator: Associate Professor fiva P6sfay
The French and Francophone Studies Concentration unites a diversity of disciplinary approaches to France while extending the notion of French and Francophone Studies beyond the specific territorial and linguistic boundaries of France and Parisian French. Relying on a solid language training, courses offered in French literature of France, Francophone literature of Africa and the Caribbean, film studies, social, political and art history, and economic, will afford a synthetic view of the evolution and impact of French cultural institutions. The majors most organically connected with French Studies are French, history, anthropology, art history, and political sci- ence, although students majoring in other disciplines may also concentrate in French and Francophone Studies.

In our changing global environment, communication is the key to understanding other peoples and cultures. After your first year of German at Carleton, you will have the oral proficiency to live and study in a German-speaking country. Our programs in Berlin, Munich, Nuremberg, and Graz, Austria, offer wide-ranging choices in location. They give you the chance to apply what you learned in your German class in a European environment. (You'll also be surprised how far German gets you in the Czech Republic and Hungary!)
Since the fall of the Wall and the establishment of the European Union as an economic and political power, the question of German identity has again come to the forefront. Its philosophi- cal and literary foundations are crucial to an understanding of the country. You will gain the skills to read important writers and thinkers in the original German: Goethe, Schiller, Kafka, Rilke, Mann, Freud, Brecht, Crista Wolf, Ingeborg Bachmann.

German Life and Literature at the Dawn of the New Millennium In this course, we will examine major works of literature, film and non-fiction in the German-speaking countries written between 1995 and 2000. Important cultural and political themes to be discussed through and in these works will be national identity, minority literatures, feminist visions and revisions, and the evolution of an environ- mentalist consciousness. However, we will not only read these works as cultural and political documents of their time, but also pay atten- tion to their textual qualities as plays, novels, poems, and films.

Who can legitimately remember? What dif- ferent modes of representation are permissible, appropriate or desirable? These are the ques- tions this course tries to answer. 6 credits, AL, Winter Ñ N. Kramer
282. The Forest In German Literature, Culture, and Environmental Politics Cross-listed with ENTS 282. A study of the forest as an impor- tant natural and symbolic phenomenon for understanding the relationship of humans to nature in German-speaking societies.

350. Two Countries - One Nation? Germany and the Cold War The fall of the Berlin Wall and the creation of one German State in 1990 has caused a debate. Does this event reflect a "reunification" of "two countries that belonged together" or, is this a "unification" of two disparate political and cultural units that have evolved since WWII. We will address this question within the context of the debate on German identity and nationalism. We will explore literature, film, theater, social and cultural politics, along with a special emphasis on the phenomenon of the "Grenzganger" who transcendends the physi- cal and intellectual boundaries between the two German States. Conducted in German. Prerequisite: German 204 or the equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.

Possible playwrights include Georg Kaiser, Bert Brecht, Wolfgang Borchert, Rolf Hochhuth, Peter Handke, Heiner Muller, Thomas Bernhard, and perhaps a twenty-first century writer. Videos of play productions and our own dramatic readings of scenes will help us explore some of the century's theories of act- ing and staging. Conducted in German. Prerequisite: German 204 or the equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
360. The Song that Sleeps in Everything: German Poetry through the Ages Starting with the Baroque era, we will examine German poems as expressions of the literary movements that gave birth to them. Since the class will focus on each poem as representative of an aesthetic code grounded in specific literary movements, this class is also an excellent introduction to German literary history. We will read the poems, discuss them, listen to recordings and do our own lyrical or dramatic readings. Selections will include poems set to music, as well as twentieth century Cabaret. Interested students may also try their hand at transla- tion. Conducted in German. Prerequisite: German 204 or equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Spring Ñ S. Leonhard

101,102,103. Elementary Modern Hebrew
Think beyond the Bible! Modern Hebrew is a vital language in several professional fields, ranging from international relations to scien- tific engineering. This course sequence is for students with no previous knowledge of Hebrew or whose test scores indicate that this is an appropriate level of placement. We will focus on the seven verb patterns that structure Modern Hebrew and on how root letters work to build vocabulary. We will continually inte- grate listening, speaking, reading, and writ- ing in Hebrew, incorporating popular Israeli music, radio programs and advertisements, and films, into level appropriate class activi- ties and assignments. 6 credits, ND, Fall, Winter, Spring Ñ S. Beckwith
204. Intermediate Modern Hebrew In this course students will strengthen their com- mand of modern literary and newspaper Hebrew. Depending on students' interests, we will also focus on building proficiency in Hebrew for international relations, for the sci- ences, or for other optional fields. As in the elementary sequence, we will continually inte- grate listening, speaking, reading and writing in Hebrew. Popular Israeli music, radio pro- grams and advertisements, and films, will complement the course's goals and class activ- ities, 6 credits, ND, Winter Ñ S. Beckwith
221. Israeli Literature in the Middle East We
will survey the development of Hebrew fic- tion in Israel, focusing on how Hebrew authors view their local and surrounding Middle Eastern environs. We will examine how Jewish immigrants from European and Arab countries imagined Israel as a nation (1940s - 1950s). We will then study fiction by Israeli authors from the 1960's through the 1982 Lebanon War (a cultural catalyst), and the contemporary peace process. Through a selection of Egyptian, Lebanese, and Palestinian fiction, we will extend our under- standing of Arab societies and Israeli nation- hood.

Requirements for a Major:
A total of 66 credits from courses taken in the History Department. First year seminars (History 110s) and the comprehensive exercise both count toward the total number of credits. Certain courses offered outside the History Department may count toward the major; consult the department chair for specific information. Courses in ancient history are taught in the Classics
department. Credit toward the major will also be awarded for a 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in American or European History.
A student must take courses in at least three of the following eight fields: Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, Middle East/Islamic history, Europe to 1450, Europe Since 1450, and the United States. The Department expects that a student majoring in History will com- plete four courses (24 credits) in his or her primary field and two courses (12 credits) in each of two secondary fields. At least one of the student's three fields must be non-western history-East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Middle East/Islamic history-and one of the fields must be in western history (Europe before 1450, Europe After 1450, United States including African-American history). In consultation with faculty, students may also propose a self- designed thematic field as their primary field (e.g., Gender and History, Colonialism, Central Asia). Interested students should consult the department for more information. The History major must complete a research seminar (History 395), normally in the primary field, the History Colloquium (History 298), and the senior integrative exercise (History 400).
Some courses numbered below 200 are open to first year students. First year students may not register in courses numbered 200 and above without the written permission of the instruc- tor. It is recommended that students planning to major in history take History 110 and one or two other courses during their first year. History majors who are interested in study and research in a major library should consider the Newberry Library Seminar program.

of India into the post-colonial nation-states of India and Pakistan in 1947 was one of the most tumultuous events in modern history: over twelve million people were displaced and almost one million died. Memories of the par- tition continue to haunt present day politics in the subcontinent. This course will look at how questions of religious, caste, class and gender identities shaped the events leading up to Partition and the ensuing violence. Using political writings, oral history, films and liter- ature, we will attempt to bring together the grand politics, public memory, and private voices that shape our understanding of 1947. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Fall - P. Sengupta

After looking at some influential models, the course will focus on selected case studies that will allow us to analyze medieval experiences of the transfor- mation of religious identity, whether personal or social. Our readings will allow us to see how the conversion experience has been inter- preted both in different periods of the Middle Ages and in different scholarly disciplines and to ask what conversion means for the histo- rian. Topics will include: conversion to and from Judaism; heretical movements; women's conversions and male paradigms; the intellec- tual conversion of Islam. 6 credits, HU, Winter - V. Morse

119. Frontiers in Early America Cross-listed with AMST 113. This introduction to colonial American history will consider the frontier as both place and metaphor in order to under- stand this period. More than a simple geo- graphic line, the early American frontier was also a zone of racial, gender, economic, and military interactions between peoples, empires, and cultures. Through the idea of the frontier, this dass will explore the wide range of ideologies and experiences in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century North America. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.

134. The Mediterranean in the Middle Ages The theory that the focus of affairs in Europe turned northwards after the Muslim conquests of North Africa and Spain has been highly influential in shaping courses on medieval Europe. More recently, however, attention has focused on the rich culture of contact among the peoples of the Mediterranean throughout the medieval period. Through lectures and critical discussion of primary sources, this course will explore the many faces of this con- tact, including trade, warfare, political ties, missions, and artistic and intellectual influ- ences. Our primary focus will be on the

138. The Making of Europe What are the ori- gins of what we call "Europe?" How did this corner of the Eurasian continent come to play a predominant role in world history? What forces worked to create or to undermine a rec- ognizably "European" culture? While cultural developments and new institutions offered powerful sources of shared experience and practice, national states and self-conscious, localisms introduced new lines of fragmenta- tion. Through lectures and discussion of a wide variety of primary sources from the period this class will examine these competing tendencies as they shaped the history of Europe's peoples during the later Middle Ages and the early Renaissance. 6 credits, HU, Spring Ñ V. Morse

A concern throughout will be the relationship between elites and the masses, and how popular religious and cul- tural movements have often served as a way for the latter to challenge the status quo. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
275. Twentieth Century Cuba Cross-listed with LTAM 275. If, as Ernesto "CHE" Guevara once remarked, "Revolutions are made of pas- sions," it is equally true they provoke them. Since the victory of Fidel Castro's guerrilla army over forty years ago, Cuba's revolution continues to generate controversy and to inflame the passions of both friends and foes. What is the real story behind the Cuban revo- lution, and what will the future hold for the Western Hemisphere's sole socialist country? This course will offer some insight by examin- ing the historical conditions leading up to Castro's victory, the early decades of the socialist regime, and recent changes as Cuba struggles to survive in the post-Soviet era. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
280. Women and Work in African History Cross- listed with AFAM 280 and WGST 280.
African women have frequently been termed the "invisible workers" of their societies.
Using the theoretical concepts of gender, class and patriarchy, this course will analyze the productive and reproductive roles of women
in African history, in order to improve their "visibility." 6 credits, HU, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
282. Women in African History: (Reproduction, Representation, and Resistance Cross-listed with WGST 283. This course will explore several themes that are central to understanding the changes n African women's lives and experi-
ences in the countryside and the city from before colonialism to the present: work, edu- cation, labor migration, marriage, sexuality, motherhood, political action and creativity. Readings will include both primary and sec- ondary sources, as well as historiographic arti- cles outlining issues in African women's history and the novels and autobiographies through which African women have begun to make their voices heard. But women in Africa do not speak as one, and thus we will also study the differences of race, gender, class and culture. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
283. Africa Before the Europeans: The Dark Continent? Cross-listed with AFAM 283. Through epics, origin myths, praise songs, poetry, ethnographic materials, historical works and novels, this seminar will explore Africa's rich pre-colonial past, paying particu- lar attention to material and social change and the ways in which both ruling elites and "ordinary" men and women-farmers, herders, traders, slaves-helped to shape their worlds. The course challenges Western depictions of Africa as the "dark continent" by showing that African peoples had vibrant cultures and sophisticated technologies, participated in far- reaching commercial and political networks, and maintained dynamic (and internally dif- ferentiated) social systems for centuries before the arrival of Europeans on African shores. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
298. Junior-year History Colloquium In the jun- ior year, majors must take six-credit reading and discussion course taught each year by dif- ferent members of the department faculty. The general purpose of History 298 is to help students reach a more sophisticated under- standing of the nature of history as a disci- pline and of the approaches and methods of historians. A major who is considering off-

 campus study in the junior year should con- sult with their advisor on when to take
343. Empire and Nation in Russian History This course provides a historical survey of the imperial dimension of Russian history. We will discuss the evolution of national identi- ties among the peoples of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union (including the
Russians). This is a reading-intensive, discus- sion based course. Prerequisite: History 240 and/or 241 desirable. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
345. Atlantic Revolutions, France and America
Cross-listed with AMST 346 and FRST 345.
An examination of the recent literature on the French and American Revolutions to establish a basis for a comparative approach to both revolutions. Our approach will include social, political, intellectual and cultural perspectives on a variety of subjects illuminating the reci- procity between the revolutions. The course will not concern itself with a detailed narra- tive of either revolution so some solid knowl- edge of one or both of these revolutions is assumed. This will be a reading intensive course heavily dependent on class discussion. Written work will consist of one short critical review at the mid-term and a final, more extensive analytic paper. Permission of the instructors is required. 6 credits, HU, Spring Ñ C. Weiner, S. Zabin
346. Imperialism An analytical study of the phenomenon of imperialism, its impact on the evolution on mass as well as world politics, and its economic, social and cultural-ideologi- cal implications in the classical era of European imperialism, c.1880-1914. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.

The Latin American Studies Program provides a framework for systematically studying the diverse and complex societies of Latin America. With its cultural mosaic shaped by the meeting of Native American, European, African, and Asian peoples, and its profound geographic, social, and economic variations, Latin America presents rich opportunities for interdisciplinary and cross-cultural study. By drawing upon the perspectives and methodologies of several disciplines, students are challenged to pursue a deeper understanding of the cultures institutions, and expe- riences of Latin Americans. The program provides a forum for examining the intersection of issues of politics, economic development, ethnicity, gender, religion, and cultural expression.
Requirements for a Major:
Students take a minimum of sixty-six credits in approved courses for the major, including five required courses and the integrative exercise (see list below). No more than four courses (twenty-four credits) in any one discipline may apply to the major. A maximum of 27 credits from programs abroad may be counted for elective credits.
Majors must demonstrate competence in Spanish by completing Spanish 205 or by examination.
A sophomore who wishes to major in Latin American Studies should, with the help of a fac- ulty advisor, plan his or her program for the major, and submit it in writing for consideration and approval by the Latin American Studies Committee.
If possible, majors should complete the required courses, except the senior seminar and inte- grative exercise, by the end of their junior year. During their senior year, majors are required to participate in a designated senior seminar and to complete the integrative exercise.
Majors are encouraged to study on the Carleton Morelia Program in Mexico, the Associated Colleges of the Midwest Programs in Costa Rica, or another of the approved programs in Latin American countries. (The Office of Off-Campus Studies has information on these and other study opportunities.)

 144 LINGUISTICS
LINGUISTICS (LING)
Director: Professor Michael J. Flynn Professor: Michael J. Flynn
Linguistics is the study of the remarkable capacity of human beings to learn, use and manipu- late the stunningly complex and orderly systems we call languages. Carleton offers a range of courses on this topic. In addition to those listed below, see those listed under the Cognitive Studies Concentration. There is not a regular major in Linguistics, but sometimes a special major is possible. Please see our web page for up to date information.
Linguistics Courses
110. Introduction to Linguistics The capacity to acquire and use natural languages such as English is surely one of the more remarkable features of human nature. In this course, we explore several aspects of this ability. Topics include the sound systems of natural lan- guages and gestural systems of signed lan- guages (and the relation between these), principles that regulate word order (and what these reveal about the nature of the mind), the course of language acquisition in children,
and some of what is known about how knowl- edge of language is realized in the human brain. No prerequisite. 6 credits, SS, Fall, Spring Ñ M. Flynn
111. Writing Systems Refer to ASLN 111 for description. 6 credits, SS, Spring - M. Hansell
115. Introduction to the Theory of Syntax This course is organized to enable the student to actively participate in the construction of a rather elaborate theory of the nature of human cognitive capacity to acquire and use natural languages. In particular, we concentrate on one aspect of that capacity: the unconscious acquisition of a grammar that enables a speaker of a language to produce and recog- nize sentences that have not been previously encountered. In the first part of the course, we concentrate on gathering notation and termi- nology intended to allow an explicit and man-
ageable description. In the second part, we depend on written and oral student contribu- tions in a cooperative enterprise of theory con- struction. No prerequisite. 6 credits, SS, Winter Ñ M. Flynn
120. Words This course will examine the nature of words, how they are structured, how their forms and meanings evolve, and what all of this tells us about the nature ofKuman cog- nition. No prerequisite. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
180. The Japanese Language Cross-listed to ASLN 180. This course will examine some aspects of Japanese from the viewpoint of lin- guistic theory. It is not taught in Japanese, nor is it a course in which students will learn Japanese. Instead, we will look at the lan- guage in the same way that a biologist might look at a complicated organism, as an interest- ing object of study. We will examine its his- tory, aspects of its structure, its use in social and artistic contexts, as well as its extraordi- nary writing system. Some knowledge of Japanese would be helpful, but is not
required. No knowledge of linguistics will be presupposed. N o prerequisites. 6 credits, SS, Spring - M. Flynn
190. Language and Gender As social beings, we order our existence according to characteristics that link us to and distinguish us from each

 other. One of the most salient of these is gen- der, and since language is the primary sym- bolic system by which we express our experiences, it is no surprise that language and gender interact in intricate ways. This course explores the relationships between lan- guage, gender, and society. In what ways do men and women use language differently? How do these differences reflect and/or main- tain gender roles in society? While the course takes primarily a linguistic perspective, it will also draw on insights from anthropology, soci- ology, psychology, and women's and gender studies. No prerequisite. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
210. Language Universal From the earliest days of the field, linguists have wondered why the grammars of languages are so similar, a question that turns out to have important implications for constructing a typology of languages and for understanding human cog- nition. This course examines potentially uni- versal aspects of language, with topics ranging from grammatical categories such as tense, aspect and deixis, to patterns of word order and constructions such as relative clauses and passivization. We will pay particular attention to the range of variation allowed for each uni- versal and the explanations, both functional and formal, that have been offered to explain their existence. Prerequisite: Linguistics 110. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001 -2002.
215. The Syntax of an Unfamiliar Language In
this course we examine, with the help of a native speaker informant, the syntax of a lan- guage deliberately chosen for its being unfa- miliar to all the participants. Our goal will be to construct a coherent and theoretically respectable account of some of the principles that enter into the cognitive organization of speakers of the selected language. Each stu- dent will investigate some aspect of the lan-
guage in depth, culminating in a class presen- tation and research report. Prerequisite: Linguistics 115. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
217. Phonetics and Phonology Although no two utterances are ever exactly the same, we humans don't function like tape recorders; we overlook distinctions to which mechanical recording devices are sensitive, and we "hear" contrasts which are objectively not there. What we (think we) hear is determined by the sound system of the language we speak. This course examines the sound systems of human languages, focusing on how speech sounds are produced and perceived, and how these units come to be organized into a systematic net- work in the minds of speakers of languages. Prerequisite: Linguistics 110. 6 credits, SS, Fall - M. Flynn
237. Language and Mind Cross-listed with PHIL 241* An exploration of the ways in which lin- guistic theory has an impact on our judgment of the nature of the organization of human cognition. We will consider modern reformu- lations of classical philosophical problems as well as the relation of contemporary linguistic theory to related disciplines in the cognitive sciences such as psychology. Prerequisite: Experience in linguistics or permission of instructor. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001 - 2002.
240. Dialects Cross-listed with SOAN 241. In this course, we examine the power of dialect as a means of expressing our own, and identi- fying other people's, social identities. Using both linguistic and sociological criteria, we address such questions as: What is a dialect? In what ways do social phenomena such as regional loyalties, socioeconomic status, eth- nicity, gender and age shape the dialect we speak? What consequences does dialect varia-

tion have with regard to social equality? To what extent can this variation help us under- stand how and why languages change over time? Prerequisite: Linguistics 110 or another linguistics course and consent of the instruc- tor. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
250. Linguistics and the Literary Art Refer to ENGL 250 for description. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
260. Historical Linguistics Cross-listed with ASLN 260. Concepts and techniques of his- torical linguistics, especially methods used in the discovery of family relationships between languages and the reconstruction of ancestral forms. Other topics include grammatical, semantic, and lexical change, processes of sound change, language contact, and the use of linguistic evidence in cultural reconstruc- tion. In addition to the more familiar Indo- European languages, data will come from Western Pacific and Australian languages, and especially East Asian languages. Prerequisite: previous experience in linguistics or instruc- tor's permission. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
270. Language, Speech, and Evolution
Languages can be thought of as abstract
devices that link signals and messages. For the signal part, the vast majority of human lan- guages use speech. Speech production and speech perception are both very complicated, probably unique to human beings, and
"tuned" to each other in interesting ways. In this course we will have a close look at the relevantTmechanisms, with the goal of approaching the question of how this remark- able system could have arisen in our species. Prerequisite: Linguistics 110 or permission of the instructor. 6 credits, SS, Winter - M. Flynn
301. Language Survey This course will be a linguistic survey of the second (and perhaps third) languages spoken by the participants. Prerequisites: Linguistics 110, 115 and 217. 3 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
317. Topics in Phonology More on phonology, with special attention to issues involving chil- dren, such as acquisition and delay. Prerequisite: Linguistics 217. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
340. Topics in Semantics Semantics is the study of the relation between languages and the things (construed broadly) that languages are "about." Prerequisite: Philosophy 210. 6 cred- its, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
372. Speech Disorders: Clinical and Theoretical Aspects This course is offered in cooperation with Dr. John Schnorr, Speech Pathologist at the Northfield Public Schools. It has two sep- arate but interlocking parts. First, students in the class will, under Dr. Schnorr s direction, work with young people in the Northfield schools who are experiencing a language delay of one sort or another. The Carleton students will be involved in evaluation and therapy. Back at the College, our regular class sessions will use readings from the theoretical and clinical literature to address questions like these: What does linguistic theory tell us about what these children are doing with their language? What does what these chil- dren are doing tell us about the nature of lan- guage? Prerequisite: Linguistics 317. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
399. Senior Thesis The planning, preparation, and completion of a significant paper in lin- guistics under the direction of a member of the department. 3 credits, ND, S/CR/NC, Not offered in 2001-2002.

 LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES (LCST)
150. Amazons, Valkyries, Naiads, and Dykes Cross- listed with WGST 150. Is there such a thing as "queer art"? Can "queer art," as an alternative form of expression, have a "canon?" Does sexual identity make any difference to aesthetics? If so, whose sexuality? And whose aesthetics? These are some of the questions we ask in this intro- duction to gender and art by way of some fasci- nating (if little known) "women-identified" texts, from Sappho to Aphra Behn, Gertrude Stein, Ulrike Ottinger, Audre Lord, Carmelita Tropicana, and others. Format: Lecture and dis- cussion. No prerequisites. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Spring - D. Nemec Ignasbev

240. Flight of the Firebird: Peoples, Languages and Legends of Eurasia Cross-listed with RUSS 240. This course surveys the diversity of nations-large and small-inhabiting Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Western Siberia. Topics will include geogra- phy, historical linguistics, religion, and folk- lore. Readings from primary and secondary sources will be combined with film, music, and electronic resources. Analytical techniques will range from the encyclopedic catalogues and grammars of eighteenth-century neo-clas- sicism to post-colonialist discourse analysis. Taught in English, foreign language is not prerequisite, but encouraged. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
245. Introduction to Critical Methods: Structure, Gender, Culture Cross-listed with FRST 254.
What does it mean to theorize the way we read? For one thing, it means to reflect on the assumptions already implicit in our reading habits; for another, it invites us to challenge those assumptions to see what might be gained. Changes of perspective can have signif- icant impact, for the set of questions we bring to our reading largely determines the answers we come away with. In this course we will study a range of critical issues and movements, and we will examine how they can influence our reading of texts (prose, poetry, film) drawn from a variety of national traditions. Open only to declared majors of literature or lan- guage programs or permission of instructor. 6 credits, AL, Winter Ñ S. Carpenter

250. This course presents an overview of self- proclaimed or otherwise claimed "lesbian" texts and contexts since World War II, drawn from diverse communities (in and outside the US), and discussed in light of post-modernist and (post)-feminist theories of the construc- tion of gender and of culture. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
270. Degeneration and the Fin de Steele In Europe at the end of the nineteenth century, the prevailing faith in forward progress was counterbalanced by the notion that Western civilization might actually be in decline-a decline characterized by neurosis, criminality and social decay. This course will examine biological, anthropological and philosophical theories of degeneration and their impact on the intellectual history, popular culture and belles lettres of the time. After studying theo- retical treatises by Morel, Lombroso and Nordau, we will discuss the works of so-called "degenerate" artists such as Zola, Ibsen, Wagner and Nietzsche. No prerequisite, but opportunities for using knowledge of French, German, Russian or Italian. 6 credits, AL, Fall - L. Goering

The Media Studies Program serves as a center for those interested in the formal study of film, video, television and the internet. Course work is of three related kinds: 1) study of past and present connections between film, video, television and other arts-photography, music, theater, dance and painting, 2) study of both narrative and non-fiction film and video and their relation to other disciplines-history, sociology, psychology, American Studies, etc., and 3) production classes to provide the essential "hands-on" experience for understanding and creating video and multimedia.

Media Studies Courses
110. Introduction to Media Studies An intro- duction to film, television, and digital media from multiple perspectives: formal, cultural, and theoretical. How do films tell their sto- ries? How do they reflect some of the histori- cal and cultural issues of their time, including gender and race? What are the formal and cultural significances of television and digital media? How are we constructed differently, as spectators, in relation to various media? These questions will be addressed by studying a variety of texts, including Hollywood, avant- garde, and documentary film, TV sitcoms and soap operas, and the world wide web. Discussion will focus on applying critical con- cepts to screenings and clips. 6 credits, AL, Fall - C. Donelan
112. Screenwriting In this introduction to writing for the screen, students will first orally present either a full-length motion pic- ture idea or a 20-30 minute short film idea, which is critiqued by the class. Students then write the first 30 script pages of the full- length film idea or their entire shorter idea. (Short projects may then be filmed in Fiction Video Production, offered in the spring.) All projects will be critiqued by the class and judged on professional standards, with analy- sis which is exacting, rigorous and encourag- ing. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
114. Film History and Criticism From the two- minute Edison primitives to the epic-length wide-screen movies of the 70's, we survey the evolution of the modern film form in the U.S. and abroad, paying particular attention to eras dominated by German Expressionism, Russian Formalism, French New Wave and the omnipresence of Hollywood. Historical examples and current strategies of film criti- cism provide a second, coordinate part of the course. 6 credits, HU, Winter Ñ C. Donelan
115. Music and the Media Refer to MUSC 115 for description. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
116. The Hollywood Film Musical Refer to MUSC 116 for description. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
122. Video Production for Community Television
Explore how local communities are using cable television to reaffirm civic and cultural identity in an age of homogenizing mass media. This course offers a rich experience in "service learning" as students make video projects for broadcast on Northfield's own community cable station. No prerequisite other than the short, non-credit Introduction to Video Production offered by the Carleton Media Lab. 3 credits, ND, Spring - P. Hager

223. Films of Frank Capra Cross-listed with AMST 216. A Sicilian immigrant, Capra became Hollywood's voice for the American Dream. His Oscar-winning films (// Happened One Night, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, MeetJohn Doe, and It's a Wonderful Life) proclaim Capra s concept of libertarian America. Capra scorned political propaganda, yet today his comedies still seduce viewers into believing we can all be "ordinary" heroes. In this course we will work toward understanding the ideology embedded in his major films. 3 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
224. Film's Narrative Strategies Unlike the nov- elist, who must create passions with printed words, a filmmaker uses lighting, color, cam- era angles, unanticipated editing, sound design, music, special effects, and known actors to shape audience responses. This course will provide a brief, intensive study of the variety of narrative techniques used in classical and modern films including Citizen Kane, Persona, Magnolia, Groundhog Day. 3 credits, AL, Spring - V. Bailey
225. Hitchcock: The Classic Films Cross-listed with AMST 229* The name, even the mere profile of Alfred Hitchcock, suggest films of suspense beyond our expectations. Even more surpris- ing, is the range and influence of his narrative formulations. He may be the screen's greatest rhetorician, the director most capable of tai- loring the film image to the viewer's response. We will test this idea through a selective ret- rospective of eight of his more thematically- profound films. 3 credits, AL, Spring - V. Bailey
226. The Films of Ingmar Bergman: High Seriousness Bergman's intense and unrelenting studies of human relationships have earned
him a dominant place among exponents of "serious cinema." His films examine the dilemma of a modern Everyman who is lonely, vulnerable and starved of faith and love. We will examine the form and content of represen- tative Bergman films, including: The Seventh Seal, The Silence, Persona, Cries and Whispers. 3 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
227. Open the Box: Studies in Television
Television is probably the most important socializing agent in American culture apart from the family. Yet we seem more comfort- able looking down our nose at the medium, rather than scratching our heads about it. This course draws on the rapidly expanding literature of cultural theory that addresses tel- evision as both ideology and social form. We will examine the cultural exchanges found in genres such as news, soap opera and advertis- ing, and the external contexts of the medium such as ratings and the regulatory context. Prerequisite: Media Studies 110. 6 credits, HU, Winter - C. Donelan
228. Rethinking the Fifties Through Film, Television and Photography Cross-listed with AMST 258. Disguised in a poodle skirt and

Elvis wig, Fifties America remains a nostalgic caricature for many students. This course
offers a revisionary social history of this com- plex decade by examining a broad range of visual media. We'll consider key issues like
the rise of consumer culture, the policing of gender, the "invention" of teens, Cold War paranoia, the rise of suburbia, the explosion of popular culture, television's "living room lec- tures," and smell-o-vision, 6 credits, AL, Fall Ñ
J. Schott
229. Outsiders Cinema: Fiction Film This course considers fiction films produced in conscious (if not militant) opposition to Hollywood, films driven by esthetic, moral or expressive commitments rather than the bottom line. In addition to doing close readings of fifteen or so films, we will consider the cultural, esthetic, economic and biographical circum- stances that inform each work. The course will emphasize films that have been consid- ered landmarks in post-war independent fic- tion-with an emphasis on projects of the last ten years-from Cassevete's Husbands (1970) to Tarentino's Pulp Fiction (1995). 6 credits, AL, Winter-J. Schott
231. Japanese Cinema This course examines the extraordinary achievement of Japanese cinema from the 1930s to the present, from the clas- sic films of Ozu, Mizoguchi, and Kurosawa to the pop cinema of "Beat" Takeshi Kitano and the phenomenon of "anime." We will study films such as Tokyo Story, Ugetsu, Throne of Blood, Tampopo and Hana-Bi, among others, in their aesthetic, cultural and auteurist contexts. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
232. Cinema at the Edge: The Idea of the Avant- Garde This class traces the development of avant-garde film, video and multi-media from Salvadore Dali s surrealist cinema in the '20's to contemporary virtual reality on the inter-
net. Along with examining key paradigms of experimentalism (art cinema, video art, hyper- media, etc.), we will consider theoretically how the avant-garde defines itself at differing moments in history. The class will feature an extended "field trip" into Beat culture of the 1950's, where we will look at beat cinema in the context of poetry, music and the visual arts. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
233. Italian Neorealism and Its Legacy An intro- duction to the key films and theories of Italian neorealism. We will begin by looking closely at the traditional neorealist films of Rossellini, De Sica, and Visconti in relation to the theories of Bazin and Zavattini. We will then turn our attention to films by Fellini, Pasolini, and Antonioni, among others, that question or problematize traditional neoreal- ism, from films situated on the boundaries of the tradition, to films said to constitute a break with the tradition, to films that recon- sider the tradition from contemporary per- spectives. We will conclude the course by considering the impact of neorealism in an international context. 6 credits, AL, Spring - C. Donelan
234. Film Noir: The Dark Side of the American Dream After Americans grasped the enormity of the Depression and World War II, the glossy fantasies of 30s cinema seemed hollow indeed. During the 40s, the movies, our true national pastime, took a nosedive into pes- simism. The result? A collection of excep- tional films chocked full of tough guys and bad women lurking in the shadows of nasty urban landscapes. This course applies the tools of formal criticism, intellectual history, and feminist theory to films like Double Indemnity, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. 6 credits, AL, Spring Ñ C. Donelan

 235. Film and the Melodramatic Imagination
You think your life is complicated? Take a
look at the spectacles of emotional excess in the films of major filmmakers such as
Griffith, Ophuls, Sirk, Minnelli, Ray, Fassbinder, and Almodovar. Seduction, betrayal, abandonment, extortion, murder, suicide, revenge, jealousy, incurable illness, obsession, compulsion-it's all there. You've
got nothing to complain about. And if you think these spectacles are pablum for passive, naive spectators, you are sorely mistaken. Join us to find out why. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
238. Border Crossings: Postmodern Perspectives on French and German Cinema Cross-listed with GERM 220, FREN 238, FRST 220. In this course, we will explore the responses of French and German filmmakers to the chal- lenges facing Europe as it redefined itself throughout the twentieth century. Taking Foucault's and Derrida's theories about the center and the margin as a starting point, we will examine such issues as national identity, marginalization, shifting gender roles and technological change. Filmmakers to be dis- cussed will be Jean-Luc Godard, Jean Renoir, Agnes Varda, Fritz Lang, Rainer W. Fassbinder and Helma Sanders-Brahms. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
241. The French Cinema Refer to FREN 233 for description. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
242. Cinemas of Loneliness: Kubrick and Scorsese With the collapse of the Hollywood studios, filmmakers were set free artistically. But this artistic freedom came with a price. As Robert Kolker notes, new Hollywood is old Hollywood without financial security and a sense of community. The freedom of new Hollywood is, in effect, the freedom to be
alone. This course examines how two major auteurs, Kubrick and Scorsese, have fared in the loneliness of new Hollywood. We will draw our conclusions by weighing the aes- thetic evidence of their key films-from Paths of Glory to Eyes Wide Shut and from Mean Streets to Raging ZW/-against outlying factors such as economics, technology, and history. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
244. Representing Reality: Nonaction Film and Video This course considers a variety of issues in the history of documentary in cinema, tele- vision and photography. While the class focuses primarily on historical and critical concerns, students will also do some exercises in both still photography and video that invite them to engage theoretical issues "in the field." 6 credits, AL, Spring -J. Schott
247. African Cinema: In Search of Identity and Self Definition Refer to FREN 248 for descrip- tion. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
250. Designing Complex Web Sites In this course students develop and design a major web site. Emphasis is on detailed project planning, information architecture, usability, design, user testing and professional graphic presentation. Students need not know HTML programming. Depending on skill levels, stu- dents can execute their sites as Photoshop pages or as an actual web site. Emphasis is on the conceptual issues of web design rather than learning a programming language. 6 credits, AL, Winter -J. Schott

net is creating the most far-reacing communi- cations revolution of modern life. Media Studies takes up where computer Science leaves off: by considering the cultural rather than the technological implications of the Internet. We will examine a range of theoreti- cal perspectives from Marshall McLuhan to "cyborg theory," and topics like changing notions of community, identity and artistic expression. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001- 2002.

Senior Media Studies Concentrators or permission of the instructor. 6 credits, AL, Fall Ñ C. Donelan
A concentration in Media Studies invites students to explore important ways modern media-film, photography, video and television-connect with and affect established disciplines. The concentration encourages study of the long-established literature-film nexus, and it also encourages students of art, history, government, sociology, music and psychology to consider media-related aspects of their major discipline.
Requirements for the Concentration:
A student must complete two core courses, four supporting courses, and the senior seminar. Core Courses (two required):
MEDA 110: Introduction to Media Studies
MEDA 114: Film History and Criticism
Supporting Courses include the following (the list will vary from year to year):

The Medieval and Renaissance Studies Concentration encourages students interested in the cul- tures and kingdoms that flourished from late Antiquity through the Renaissance to deepen their understanding of these periods through an interdisciplinary program of study. Heirs to ancient empires, the societies of Europe, Byzantium, and the Muslim world each offer fascinating oppor- tunities to watch societies cope with timeless problems of power, identity, and belief. Encompassing three key, organically interconnected historical periods, the concentration allows students to examine issues of continuity and change more fully, while its interdisciplinary offer- ings (drawing on ten disciplines) provide the student opportunities to approach these complex societies from multiple complementary perspectives. The concentration is open to students in ANY major who wish to expand their knowledge of this important and fascinating period of human history.
A total of 42 credits (usually 7 courses) is required for the concentration: 18 credits in "Core" courses, 18 credits in "Supporting" courses; and a capstone seminar (usually numbered 395). In addition to the seminars listed below, students may countÑwith prior approval of both the course instructor and the concentration coordinator'sÑother advanced seminars in which the concentrator's research focuses on a topic within the period covered by the concentration.
Optional Off-Campus Programs: Off-campus study can be an important part of the concen- tration. Students interested in study abroad as part of the concentration are advised to consult with their academic advisors in deciding when to go off-campus and with the concentration coordinators to discuss the range of programs available and potential programs of study. Courses taken abroad may count for up to two "core" courses (12 credits) and two "supporting courses" (12 credits).

General Information:
The program of the Music Department encompasses a wide variety of learning methods appro- priate to a liberal arts education. Courses in history, literature, theory, analysis, composition, ethnomusicology, and performance focus on different aspects of the broad subject, and are designed for students at all levels of musical experience. The goal of the Music Department is to provide the opportunity for students not only to continue developing the particular musical interests they bring to Carleton, but to broaden and expand those interests into new areas of study. A variety of courses with minimal or no prerequisites are open to all students, and Music
110 (Introduction to the Study of Music) leads into history, theory and more specialized survey courses for both majors and non-majors.
In addition to Music 110, Music 100, 101, 102, 108, 111, 115, 116, 117, 120, 121, 123, 130, 131, 133, 135, 137, 140, 141 and courses in applied music may be elected by students with little or no previous knowledge of music. Students interested in other music courses should
MUSIC 163

 164 MUSIC
consult the instructor concerned if in doubt as to the adequacy of their preparation. All courses with the exception of quantity-credit-only organizations (185-199) count for distribution in Arts and Literature. A maximum of 6 credits of applied music courses (150-184 and 250-289) may count for distribution credit.
A major is offered for students who wish to concentrate in music as an end in itself or in preparation for teaching, graduate study, or other work of a professional nature. Students who wish to become supervisors or teachers of music in elementary and high school may follow a plan which, supplemented by a year of graduate study elsewhere in a program such as the Master of Arts in Teaching, would ordinarily lead to the appropriate degree and certification by the second institution. At Carleton such a student would complete the normal requirements for a music major, and additional recommended courses (e.g., Music 128), and would receive the B.A. degree at the end of four years.
Credit in Applied Music and for Music Organizations:
Any student may study an instrument or voice at beginning through advanced levels, and may participate in one of the musical organizations by audition. For students not majoring in music: 1) a maximum of 36 credits in applied music may be counted toward the credits required for graduation and up to 6 credits towards distribution; 2) a maximum of 12 non-graded credits for participation in Choir, Singers, Orchestra, Pro Musica, Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, Karimba Ensemble, African Drum Ensemble, or Mbira Ensemble may be counted toward graduation, but not for distribution credit. For majors there is no credit limit.
Requirements for a Major:
Students intending to major in music should consult with the chair of the department early in their college career, since the theory and history courses follow one another in a preferred sequence. The preparation of the student is taken into account, both in applied and in theoreti- cal music, and the requirements are subject to modification in individual cases, with the approval of the department.
A major in music consists of the following core courses: Music 110, two courses in music theory (Music 200 and 201), two courses in music history (Music 211 and 312), one course in Music composition (Music 220), 298 (Junior Colloquium), one 200-level (six credit) course in ethnomusicology (such as Music 242, 243, 244, 245, or 248), Music 400 (Integrative Exercise), 6 credits in applied music (private study of an instrument or voice and Music 205, if applica- ble), and recommended participation in a performing organization or chamber music. The sequence begins with Music 110, which should be taken in either the first year or sophomore year. The core theory sequence (Music 200 and 201) should be taken either during the first year or sophomore year but can also be taken during the junior year. The core history sequence (Music 211 and 312) may be begun immediately after Music 110 and should be completed by the end of the junior year.
In addition to the core requirements, the major requires an additional 18 credits, wherein a student may construct an emphasis in one or more areas of music: music history, theory, compo- sition, ethnomusicology, applied music or conducting. Specific course suggestions may be obtained from the department chair. The more advanced student in applied music, whether major or non-major, may, at the discretion of the instructor, perform in mixed student recitals,

 chamber music, and partial or full solo recitals.
Every music major must be prepared to demonstrate basic keyboard skills. A Keyboard
Proficiency examination will be offered every fall term to test students' ability at the keyboard. The examination consists of major and minor scales, harmonization of a simple melody, sight reading and transposition of a melody, four-part score reading, and performance of simple com- positions at the level of a Clementi Sonatina. Students lacking experience at the keyboard are encouraged to take Keyboard Harmony (Music 205) and private piano lessons to pass this requirement. Students who achieve a grade of C- or above in Music 205 automatically pass the Keyboard Proficiency requirement.
Language competence in German and/or French is recommended for some graduate pro- grams.
Music Courses
100. Musical Biography and Autobiography Explores musical life through biography and autobiography, with examination of narratives about individuals in Native American, African, Latin American, Indian, and Western musical cultures. How do people interpret their own experiences of music in daily life, their roles as "musicians" or "non-musicians", and their musical cultures generally? We will consider the role of biography in musical ethnography, and each student will construct a musical biography or autobiography. 6 cred- its, S/CR/NC, AL, Fall-M. Russell

Philosophy Courses
110. Introduction to Philosophy An introduc- tion to philosophical thinking through inten- sive reading of primary philosophical sources and careful discussion and writing about them and the philosophical issues they raise. Each section (i) focuses on one fundamental area of philosophy while making connections with another such area, (ii) involves the study of both historical and contemporary texts, and (iii) pays some attention to issues of race and/or gender as they bear on the subject mat- ter of the section. All sections follow a discus- sion format and require several brief papers. There are no prerequisites. The following sec- tions are offered regularly:
110. The Roots of Obligation Ethics, one of the main branches of philosophy, seeks at least in part to account for different ways of answering the question, Ought I to be moral? In this course we shall dwell on this question by examining the roots of moral obligation. Looking to both classical and contemporary sources for enlightenment, we shall also con- sider a host of related questions. In addition to considering different theoretical answers to these questions, we shall explore implications of such answers for specific moral issues such as abortion, racial and sexual discrimination, and our obligations to those in dire need. 6 credits, HU, Fall -J. Manion

110. Democracy, Pluralism and the Liberal- Democratic State An introductory course focusing on the philosophical roots of certain contemporary controversies concerning democracy, such as the role of deliberation in the democratic process, the relationship between gender, representation, and democ- racy, and the meaning and significance of the public sphere and civil society. 6 credits, HU, Fall, Winter - A. Moltchanova
110. Virtue and Vice Instead of thinking prima- rily about duties and rights and thus about right and wrong actions, many moral philoso- phers have focused on the question of moral character, asking which character traits make one a good person or a bad one, where those traits are spoken of, respectively, as virtues and vices. The class will begin by dealing at length with Aristotle's account of character and virtue and then will consider several con- temporary variations on that theme, all by way of critically formulating our own
accounts of virtue and vice as such and of sev- eral particular virtues and vices. 6 credits, HU, Winter - P. Mason
series of lectures on the historical/cultural contexts of major philosophical positions, the interrelations among the central questions on which these positions focus, and the positions' relationships to todays philosophical discus- sions. Philosophers such as Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas will be con- sidered, and extensive selections from their writings will be read. May be taken independ- ently of Philosophy 112. No prerequisites. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
112. Introduction to Western Philosophy II: Modern and Contemporary A study of the his- tory of Western philosophy from the Renaissance to the present day. The course is a series of lectures on the historical/cultural contexts of modern philosophical positions, the interrelations among the central questions on which these positions focus, and the posi- tions' relationships to today's philosophical discussions. Emphasis is given to the ways in which modern philosophy has sought to either extend, modify, or critique the philosophical tradition it inherits. Philosophers such as Descartes, Hume, Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, James, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Rawls, and Habermas will be con- sidered, and extensive selections from their writings will be read. May be taken independ- ently of Philosophy 111. No prerequisites, 6 credits, HU, Spring Ñ R. Elveton
110. Intergalactic Knowledge How have we
acquired our knowledge of nebulae and distant
galaxies? This question has a presupposition
that most of us accept: that we have such
knowledge. But is this presupposition justi-
fied? How do we determine whether we know
something? To answer these questions, we will
investigate a number of prominent theories of
knowledge and the development of some key
features of stellar astronomy from the modern
scientific revolution through the twentieth
century. 6 credits, HU, Spring Ñ D. MacCallum the relation of logic to natural languages,

Prerequisite: 6 credits in

 philosophy or permission of the instructor. 6
credits, Winter Ñ R. Noer
255. Philosophy of Mathematics Cross-listed with MATH 234. Before 1800, the theorems of mathematics were generally regarded as para- digms of certainty, and philosophers (e.g., Plato and Kant) were happy to construct their theories on the firm bedrock of mathematics. In the nineteenth century this foundation col- lapsed as new discoveries (non-Euclidean geometry, non-commutative algebras, contin- uous nowhere-differentiable functions) forced
a critical re-examination of the foundations of mathematics. We will study some of these discoveries and in light of them ask ourselves philosophical questions such as: In what sense do mathematical objects (triangles, the num- ber 42) exist? In what sense are mathematical truths true? Why does mathematics seem- ingly describe the real world? 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
270. Ancient Philosophy The focused study of an important concept, problem, theme, tradi- tion of thought, theory, or some combination of these in the work of major Greek philoso- phers of the period between 640 BCE and 386 CE, including such philosophers as

395. Philosophical Theories of Nationhood and the International Legal System States are basic units of recognition in international relations, while the idea of a nation-state is fundamental to political thought. We take it for granted that the world territory is divided into units which are governed by sovereign states and that states express the self-determination of corresponding nations. However, despite their prevalence as basic actors on the international scene, states do not match national communi- ties, which are unequally represented in exist- ing governments. International law understands the right to self-determination of national groups only as the right to be free from former colonial powers, and the right to be free from external occupation. 6 credits, HU, Winter Ñ A. Moltcbanova
395. Transcendental Philosophy A consideration of selected texts from Kant, Husserl and con- temporary philosophers (Habermas, Derrida, Crowell, Hopkins) concerning the nature and justifiability of transcendental philosophy.

intergovernmental constraints on cities. 6 cred- its, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
211. Institutional Analysis and Development
This course draws on methods and theory from political economy, economics, cultural anthropology, game theory, and rational choice to create a framework for understand- ing rule-ordered relationships (e.g. creating constitutions, means for taking collective action, and even the daily operation of public and private organizations). We will study the work of K. Arrow, M. Olson, E. Ostrom, V. Ostrom, J. Buchanan and G. Tullock, R. Coase, H. Simon, D. North, W Riker and others. 6 credits, SS, Winter - B. Allen
215. Federalism, State and Local Politics This course examines the relationships between dif- ferent levels of government in the U.S. federal system.

group in this country, the experiences and challenges facing Latinos are valuable in pro- viding a more complete understanding of American society, history and institutions. We will explore the rich diversity of Latino com- munity life, including social history, migra- tion and urbanization, ethnic culture, labor and employment, neighborhood formation
and residential segregation, economic inequal- ity and poverty, gender and the family, politi- cal organization and mobilization, and several public policy issues confronting the Latino community. 6 credits, SS, Winter - S. Navarro

Intended for majors only. Prerequisite: Math 115 or 215. 6 credits, ND, Fall, Winter, Spring Ñ B.Johnson, K. Sathasivam
231. American Foreign Policy An introduction to the actors and processes of American for- eign policymaking and to the substance of American foreign policy. The course aims to provide students with an understanding of how knowledge of the past, the global policy environment, the processes of foreign policy- making, and the specifics of a foreign policy issue come together to help determine modern American foreign policy. The course will review the structure of the international sys- tem of states, state power and interests, the historical context of American foreign policy, actors in American foreign affairs, models of foreign policy decision making, and the instruments of foreign policy. 6 credits, SS, Spring Ñ K. Sathasivam
232. Taiwan: Political and Economic Change This five-week course will examine how an under- developed and totalitarian polity was trans- formed into a modern market economy and political democracy.

233. The Global Resurgence of Democracy Cross- listed with LTAM 233. An introduction to the comparative study of democracy and its alter- natives in the twentieth century. The course
will assess the fortunes of democracy in devel- oped and lesser developed capitalist and post- communist countries in the twentieth century. What factors explain the rise and fall of democracy in these cases? How do authoritar- ian regimes emerge, function, and decompose? What are the political, economic, social and psychological effects on societies that survive authoritarianism and make transitions to democracy? This course is particularly useful in preparing for the comps exam or writing a comps paper in comparative politics. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001 -2002.
234. The Arab-Israeli Conflict A study of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the current interna- tional state of relations in the Middle East is the focus of this course. Lectures on the ori- gins of the conflict do not lay blame on any of the parties, but do outline the contours of the clash of destinies that is the Arab-Israeli con- flict. Concepts gleaned from both the security and conflict resolution literatures will be used to give analytic context to the study. Global, regional, and domestic political factors will be examined to determine their influence on the relation of force to diplomacy, as well as incre- mental versus comprehensive approaches to the peace process. A class simulation will be used to explore war and peace scenarios. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
235. The Cold War: Soviet and American Foreign Policy This course looks at the interaction of Soviet and American foreign policies from the end of World War II up through 1991. Class sessions focus equally on American and Soviet policy formation.

Case studies include Berlin, the race for nuclear weapons,
POLITICAL SCIENCE 203

 204 POLITICAL SCIENCE
Korea, East Europe in the 1950s, the Suez crisis, the Sino-Soviet conflict, and the begin- nings of the Vietnam War. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
236. National Security Policy With the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of the Soviet threat, there has been an ongoing debate concerning the future direction and priorities of U.S. national security/defense pol- icy. This course joins this debate by reviewing and analyzing the fundamental principles and the substance of U.S. security policy. At the end of the course students should be able to specify U.S. security interests around the world, identify and evaluate actual and poten- tial threats to those interests, and propose and analyze policy options for dealing with those threats. Group exercises will be undertaken to illustrate this policymaking process. 6 credits, SS, Winter Ñ K. Sathasivam
237. Asia and American Foreign Policy This course examines the dynamic and problematic relationship between the countries of Asia and the U.S. The course will be divided into three parts. First, the course will focus on the his- toric relationships between Asia and North America and examine topics that include the idea of "manifest destiny," the impact of World War II, and American involvement in Asian wars in Korea and Vietnam. In the middle part of the course the focus will shift to subjects that include economic interaction, military problems, and diplomatic trends. Finally, the course will require students to participate in a classroom simulation exercise. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
240. Energy and the Environment Cross-listed with ENTS 240. A study of the basic laws of thermodynamics; the development of energy resources; state and federal energy policies; energy efficiency and conservation; and sus-
tainable energy options for the future. Outside experts will participate extensively in the class. Students will carry out projects evaluat- ing alternative energy policies. 6 credits, SS, Spring - B. Casper, N. Vig
241. Ethnic Conflict This course focuses on interstate implications of ethnic conflict. Wherever one looks in the world, an ethnic conflict seems to be underway. The problem has serious implications for the future of the international system, since fewer than twenty of the more than 180 countries in existence are "ethnically homogenous." It is inevitable, then, that interstate relations will be affected by the problems experienced in a world where there is not a neat convergence between state borders and cultural boundaries, just as it is inevitable that the interstate system will affect how states cope with the demands of their multicultural realities. 6 credits, SS, Spring - K. Sathasivam
242. Hong Kong: A Relic of the Past or a Model for the Future This five-week course will examine Hong Kong s colonial past, its trans- formation from a sleepy backwater to one of the Asian economic tigers and the events lead- ing to the consequences following the terri- tory's reversion to China. It will look into the social, political and economic changes now underway and the effect they may have on Hong Kong's future. The extent and import of Americas interaction with Hong Kong will also be discussed. 3 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
250. Ancient Political Philosophy In this course we will examine ancient political philosophy through the intensive study of Plato's Republic, perhaps the greatest work of political philoso- phy ever written. What is morality? Why should a person behave morally? Wouldn't it be more satisfying to be a tyrant? What is the

 best way of life? What would a perfect society look like? What would be its customs and institutions, and who would rule? What
would it demand of us, and would that price be worth paying? These are some of the polit- ically (and personally) vital questions
addressed by the book. 6 credits, SS, Not offered during 2001-2002.
251. Modern Political Philosophy Cross-listed with FRST 251. We will follow the "march" of modern political philosophy from Machiavelli through the works of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau to Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. 6 credits, SS, Fall Ñ L. Cooper
252. American Political Thought Cross-listed with AMST 252. According to Louis Hartz, America was born liberal. Are American political traditions fundamentally individual- istic and egalitarian? If so, how do we explain race and gender hierarchies, socialist influ- ences and the long-standing ideal of the godly "city on the hill"? We will explore representa- tive texts in the American political tradition, concentrating on the Founding through the nineteenth century. Topics include the theory of the Constitution, early debates over citizen- ship, the emergence of feminism, abolitionism and race theory, and the defense and critique of industrial capitalism. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
253. Communist Political Thought: Marx to Mao An introduction to the economic and political themes in Communist literature, concentrat- ing on the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and Mao.

255. Post-Modern Political Thought Cross-listed with FRST 255. The thought and practice of the modern age have been found irredeemably oppressive, alienating, dehumanizing, and/or exhausted by a number of leading philosophic thinkers in recent years. In this course we will explore the critiques and alternative visions offered by a variety of post-modern thinkers, including Nietzsche (in many ways the first post-modern), Heidegger, Foucault, and Derrida. 6 credits, SS, Winter Ñ L. Cooper
257. American Environmental Thought Cross- listed with AMST 226 and ENTS 225. The development of American thinking about nature and humanity's relationship to it cover- ing from the nineteenth century to the pres- ent. Representative figures include Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, and Barry Commoner. 6 cred- its, SS, Spring - K. Smith
258. Politics and Ambition Is personal ambition a threat to peace and the public good or is it a prod to nobility and heroism? Does it exem- plify the opposition between self and society
or does it represent their intersection and mutual supportÑor both? Drawing on liter- ary, philosophical, and historical works this course will take up these and other questions
as part of a broad examination of the role of ambition in politics. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
259. Justice Among Nations This course will attempt to bring to bear great works of politi- cal philosophy on the central questions of international relations, questions concerning both the moral basis of power and the charac- ter of international politics. Readings will be drawn from ancient and modern political phi- losophy and will culminate in an analysis and evaluation of contemporary international rela-

tions theory in light of these earlier thinkers. 6 credits, SS, Spring Ñ L. Cooper
262. Environmental Policy and Politics Cross- listed with ENTS 262. Study of U.S. federal environmental and natural resource policies since the 1960s with particular emphasis on the regulation of air and water pollution, haz- ardous and toxic wastes, and public land man- agement.

263. European Political Economy An introduc- tion to the politics of the European region during the post-World War II period. Students will examine the political conditions that gave impetus to the creation, mainte- nance, crisis, and decline of Keynesian eco- nomic policies, social welfare states, social democratic partisan alliances, and cooperative patterns of industrial relations. The course will examine the rise and reform of the project of European integration. The course will also address the particular problems faced by the East European countries as they attempt to make a transition from authoritarian, com- mand economies to democratic, market-based economies. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
265. Politics of Global Economic Relations This course examines the interaction of national politics and international economic activity.

342. International Conflict and War* Will look at insights into large-scale conflict and war which can be obtained from the work of peace researchers, conflict resolution theorists, and international relations specialists. A persistent cause of war has been the readiness of societies to resort to force in order to reduce a per- ceived threat to their security, or to their political, sociocultutal, or economic value sys- tems. The scientific study of war is premised on the assumption that there are patterns and regularities in conflict behavior that can be identified systematically. State-, dyadic-, and system-level analyses of war will be examined, including mutual misperception, power asym- metries, and alliances. Both traditional and quantitative methods of inquiry (including correlates of war data) will be evaluated. 6 credits, SS, Fall - R. Packer
343. Turbulence in World Politics* The end of the Cold War in 1989-91 ushered in a new chapter in history. The prospects for the cre- ation of a world of peace-seeking democracies in an increasingly integrated global economy appeared favorable. Hopes for a new world order have given way to the reality of an enduring new world disorder, a disorder rooted in very fundamental phenonema. What dilemmas present themselves to a generation shaped by Cold War thinking? What does this problem of reorientation presage for the worlds security? And, finally, how will the United States meet the challenges that con- front the remaining superpower? 6 credits, SS, Winter-R. Packer

Prerequisites: Women's and gender studies 110, Political Science 122, or any the- ory class. 6 credits, SS, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
355. Contemporary Feminist Thought: Women and War* Cross-listed with WGST 355. Ancient and modern political philosophers view the duty to defend one's country as an essential part of citizenship. In many modern liberal democracies, military service is also consid- ered an essential individual right. While women have often been exempted or pre- cluded from military service, they nevertheless have played important symbolic and actual roles in warmaking. The status of woman as the nurturer of the warrior and the potential for women to be warriors raise a number of questions in feminist theory and democratic theory that this advanced seminar will exam- ine. 6 credits, SS, Winter - B. Allen
357.Tocqueville:TopicsCross-listedwith AMST 357. In this course students study the politi- cal theory of Alexis de Tocqueville in prepara- tion for applying democratic theory to contemporary problems in politics (e.g. juve-

to take the comprehensive examination and answer comparative political and international relations questions. The course also serves paper comps students interested in expanding their knowledge of the discipline. Finally, the course prepares students interested in pursu- ing graduate studies in comparative politics. 6 credits, SS, Winter Ñ A. Montero
386. Comparing Mexico and China* Cross-listed with LTAM 386. This course will look at con- sequences of economic globalization in two very different countriesÑChina and Mexico. Students will debate propositions from litera- ture on globalization, study real-world appli- cations, and prepare for on-site research
during December. The course will focus upon impacts of economic change on political liber- alization, the role of government in regulating social/economic dislocation, and importance of international institutions (e.g., NAFTA, WTO) in shaping local responses. During the off-campus component, students will collect data and make observations in China or Mexico. During the winter, students will pre- pare a research paper and a group presentation organized as a consulting project. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
387. Maastricht Program: The Europe of Regions
This research seminar will examine the issues facing subnational polities and economies as they deal with the project of European inte- gration. Economic and institutional change during the last twenty years have, in most subnational regions, fundamentally challenged centuries-old development patterns and cul- tures based on them. Some European regions have coped by producing innovative responses to these changes, while others have been less successful. The course will investigate the diverse paths of the European regions with an emphasis on the role of EU regional policy

Psychology at Carleton provides a systematic approach to the study of behavior and experience. It examines processes of physiological functioning, human and animal learning, human and ani- mal cognition, cognitive and social development, personality, social influence, and psy- chopathology, and treats particular topics (e.g., mental retardation, real-life decision making, and psychopharmocology) that are representative of the diversity and complexity of psychology. It also strongly emphasizes the development of analytic and expressive skills that are the basis of investigation, evaluation, and communication in the field.
Psychology 110 is the basic introductory course in the department and is a prerequisite for all other courses in psychology. Only in exceptional circumstances (i.e., an advanced placement score of 4 or 5) will a student be allowed to enroll in an upper-level psychology course without having taken Psychology 110. Majors in the department generally concentrate on one of the fol- lowing three content areas in psychology:
Biological and Behavioral Processes Courses: 210, 212, 214, 216, 318
Cognitive Studies Courses: 230, 232, 234, 236, 332
Social Behavior and Development Courses: 250, 252, 256, 258, 354, 356
Majors are advised to plan their schedules carefully in light of the prerequisites listed for upper- level courses in each area and the schedule of course offerings. A major in psychology prepares students for graduate study toward an advanced research degree in psychology and for a variety of professional programs and careers in psychological and social service areas. It also serves those intending to pursue careers in law, medicine, education, and business.

 Requirements for a Major:
The introductory course (110) unless waived by an advanced placement score of 4 or 5 and a passable grade in a midlevel course; the measurement and methods sequence (124, 126); four courses from a list of core courses (courses numbered 210-258) including one from the Biological and Behavioral Processes group (210, 212, 214, 216), one from the Cognitive Studies group (230, 232, 234, 236), and one from the Social Behavior and Development group (250, 252, 256, 258); two upper-level courses (courses numbered 310-384) including at least one seminar (365-384); two laboratory courses (211, 217, 233, 257, 259); the senior colloquium (398); and the integrative exercise (400). It is recommended strongly that all majors complete the measurement and methods sequence during their sophomore or junior years. Particular courses in biology, education, linguistics, mathematics and computer science, economics, philos- ophy, and sociology-anthropology may also be recommended, depending on an individual's interests and plans.

366. Cognitive Neuroscience It should be obvi- ous that every process that goes on in the
mind has physiological underpinnings. But, whether we can unlock the secrets of learning, memory and consciousness as they are sup- ported by neurons and neural connections is a longstanding and elusive problem in psychol- ogy. Contemporary articles are the text for
this discussion-driven course. The student should leave the class with a working under- standing of brain processes and of contempo- rary theories of brain processes that may support learning, memory, language, and con- sciousness. Psychology 110 is a required pre- requisite, 210 and 216 are recommended, but not required. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
367. Clinical Psychobiology This seminar will explore the psychobiological bases of human mental dysfunction. The major disorders-schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse-will be covered, as well as additional select topics. Prerequisite: Psychology 216 or consent of the instructor. 6 credits, MS, Not offered in 2001-2002.

 369. Behavioral Medicine This seminar will examine mind-body interactions and health- related aspects of psychology. Topics covered include psychosomatic illness, personality variables in health and disease, and nervous system-immune system interactions. 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
370. Topics in Cognition 6 credits, SS, Not offered in 2001-2002.
371. Primate Cognition Recent findings have brought to light some very compelling exam- ples of humanlike behavior in nonhuman pri- mates: tool use and tool making, family bonding, complex social behaviors such as cooperation, altruism, communication, and emotion. Each of these topics is considered in the context of the cognitive workings of the primate mind with emphases on apes (gorilla, chimpanzee) but with some evaluation of monkeys (particularly cebus and rhesus vari- eties). This course makes use of writings from primary texts on the subject (Fouts, Tomasello, Savage-Rumbaugh, Goodall). The goal is to evaluate the uniqueness of primate behavior. Psychology 210 or Psychology 212 are recommended prerequisites. Psychology 110 is a required prerequisite. 6 credits, SS, Fall - J. Neiworth
373. Categorizing Artifacts, People, and Natural Kinds Cross-listed with CGST 373. What processes underlie our categorizing of people and things? How are our categories repre- sented? How are they acquired and how do they change? How do they affect our reason- ing and perception? We will discuss the implications recent work in psychology, lin- guistics, artificial intelligence, and philosophy have for these questions, and the more general problem of the categorization of experience.

 RELIGION (RELG)
Chair: Professor Anne E. Patrick
Emeritus Professor: Bardwell L. Smith
Professors: Richard E. Crouter, Roger R. Jackson, Louis E. Newman, Anne E. Patrick
Assistant Professors: Shahzad Bashir, Michael McNally Visiting Instructor: Sara Louise McClintock
The study of religion, in the context of a liberal arts education, draws upon multiple disciplines in the humanities and the social sciences. This is reflected in the variety of courses offered within the department: some introduce a religious tradition and trace its development histori- cally; others examine in a cross-cultural context issues faced by all religious individuals and communities; and still others explore and compare diverse theories and methods employed in the study of religions. Throughout the curriculum, religion is approached as a significant and pervasive expression of human culture, both in the past and the present. Students interested in the study of religion or in a particular religious tradition are encouraged to begin by taking Introduction to Religion (Religion 110) or other introductory level courses, numbered 100-169. For those planning a career in teaching or ministry, courses in the department serve as an intro- duction to further graduate or professional study.
Requirements for a Major:
Sixty-nine credits in the department, including Religion 110; a minimum of two courses num- bered 111-169 (one in Asian, one in Western traditions); two courses numbered 211-299; two advanced seminars (320-379); Religion 300: Issues in the Study of Religion; Religion 399: Senior Research Seminar; and Religion 400: Integrative Exercise. Students planning to major in Religion should consult with their advisor in the spring of their sophomore year; a sequence of at least three courses in a religious tradition, theme, or topic is to be designed in consulta- tion with an academic advisor by the end of the junior year. Religion 300 is taken during the winter term of the junior year, Religion 399 during the winter term of the senior year, and Religion 400 in the spring term of the senior year. Since Religion 110 is a prerequisite for Religion 300, those planning to major in Religion must take Religion 110 before the winter of their junior year.

225. Contemporary Catholic Theology Christian theology was at the heart of the curriculum when universities were established at Oxford, Paris, and Bologna eight centuries ago. The discipline has changed a great deal since then, but its findings remain both fascinating and controversial today. This course will meet once a week to consider the current state of various theological questions, using recent essays by Catholic authors on topics ranging from biblical interpretation and the doctrine of God to ethics and spirituality. The course has no prerequisites; it is designed to intro- duce students to contemporary Roman Catholic theology and to prepare them for specialized work in areas such as liberationist and feminist approaches to theology. 3 credits, HU, Winter - A. Patrick

life they are developing. Previous study of Christianity is recommended but not required. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Spring - A. Patrick
228. Issues in Christian Ethics This course explores a range of issues in the practice of Christian faith, including: ethical decision making; the tensions of discipleship in a plu- ralistic culture; conscience and the authority of scripture, church, and tradition; and, moral issues related to developments in science and society, such as bioethical questions. Previous
231. Protestant Thought This course treats the historical forms, classical expressions, and reli- gious practices of Protestant Christianity from the original Reformation through the nine- teenth century. Focus is on the interpretation of texts (Luther, Calvin, Book of Common Prayer, Bunyan, Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard) and movements (Puritanism, Pietism) in their historical contexts and their contemporary rel- evance. The relationship of these texts to Roman Catholicism, to the rise of historical- critical inquiry and modern secular rationality will also be examined. 6 credits, HU, Spring - R. Crouter
235. Women and Islamic Constructions of Gender Cross-listed with WGST 232. A survey of issues significant for women's lives in vari- ous parts of the Muslim world. We will
briefly examine women's status and image in classical Islamic thought, and the bulk of the course will focus on contemporary Muslim women in a number of different cultural con- texts. Issues to be discussed include: veiling, kinship structures, war and violence, health, feminist activism, and literary and artistic expression. The course aims to provide both a broad understanding of the factors affecting women's lives, and an appreciation of the diversity of social and material conditions that exist within the Muslim world. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Spring - S. Basbir
238. Topics in Medieval History: Papacy, Church and Empire Refer to HIST 238 for description. 3 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
239. Religion and the American Landscape The
American landscape has shaped and has been shaped by the religious imaginations of its

 various inhabitants. This course considers dif- ferent ways of imagining the relationship between land, community, and the sacred and how these traditions have been inscribed on the land itself. Native American and Latino traditions will be considered, as will a variety of European-American traditions, including Puritans, Mormons, Romantics, Deep Ecologists, and immigrant farming traditions of the upper midwest. 6 credits, HU, Spring - M. McNally
247. Religion and American Popular Culture
Since the late 1950s lay participation in reli- gious institutions has declined sharply. Today, less than half of the American population attends a church, synagogue, mosque, or Buddhist temple each week. And yet, an esti- mated ninety-two percent of Americans pro- fess a belief in God, and confess also a concern with spirituality. The thesis of this course is that the expression of non-institutional reli- gion (and many institutional expressions as well) has become figured into aspects of American popular culture, including televi- sion, film and general media. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
250. Hindu Traditions An exploration of selected texts and topics from the dominant religious tradition of India. Drawing from both classical and modern sources, we con- sider a range of expressions of Hindu reli- giousness, from philosophic speculation, to mythic narrative, yogic practice, daily ritual, ecstatic devotion, and social and ethical pre- scription. Religion 150 is recommended but not required. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Winter - S. McClintock
251. Theravada Buddhism Study of Buddhism's beginnings in India and its spread to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, where it is a domi- nant religious and cultural form. The first
part of the course focuses on Theravadin inter- pretations of the Buddha's life and basic teachings, as found in the Pali canon. The sec- ond part of the course analyzes Buddhism s function as a cultural system in one or more Theravadian society, with special attention to such issues as Buddhist legitimization of secu- lar power, popular religious practices, the rela- tion between monks and laity, and the role of women. Religion 150 recommended but not required. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
252. Indian Mahayana Buddhism Self-con- sciously styled as the "Greater Vehicle" of the Buddhist tradition, the Mahayana stream of Indian Buddhism had a profound impact on the shape of Buddhism in India and beyond. This course will examine a range of Indian Mahayana doctrines and practices, focusing especially on the "new metaphysics" of empti- ness; controversies in the conception of Buddhahood; the centrality of compassion and the bodhisattva ideal; visualization and other meditation techniques; the role of faith and the practices of lay people; and the Buddhist tantra. Religion 150 recommended but not required. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Fall-S. McClintock
253. Tibetan Buddhism Against a background of the essential ideas and practices of Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism, this course examines the development within Mahayana of the esoteric traditions of Tantra, and then traces the rise and development of the complex, Tantra-dominated Buddhism of Tibet. Topics include the role of the lama, ideas about death and reincarnation, tantric meditative practices, debates about such doc- trines as emptiness and skillful means, the place of women, and the history of the Dalai Lamas.

262. Millennialism in Cross-Cultural Perspective This course is an examination of millennial and "end-time" beliefs in a variety of cultures around the world. Topics include: roots of millennial ideas, Jewish apocalypticism, beginnings of Christianity and Islam, and modern case studies from the Pacific Islands, China, Iran and the United States. The course will elicit general conclusions regarding mil- lennial and messianic ideas through detailed discussions of specific examples. Previous coursework in religious studies, history, or anthropology will be helpful but is not required. 6 credits, HU, Spring Ñ S. Bashir
268. Jews and Judaism in America Cross-listed with AMST 268. Over the past two centuries, Jews have combined elements of traditional Judaism with aspects of American culture to create distinctive forms of Jewish life and thought. We will trace the history of American Jews and analyze the character of
American Judaism, with special emphasis on the diverse contemporary forms of Jewish life. Prior study of Judaism and/or Hebrew Bible will be useful, but is not required. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
269. Jewish Ethics How do religious beliefs shape our moral perspectives? In this course we will examine the ways in which this has happened within the Jewish tradition, paying attention to both ethical theory and issues in applied ethics. Both traditional and contem- porary approaches to Jewish ethics will be examined and these will be compared with other religious as well as secular ethical tradi- tions. Prior study of religion and/or ethics will be useful, but is not required. 6 credits, HU, Winter-L. Newman

Newman
272. Pilgrimage: A Comparative Study An
exploration of pilgrimage as a ritual-expres- sion of a people's ideals and aspirations within some of the major religions of the world (Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Shinto). Topics explored include the beliefs and symbols which motivate the pro- motion and sustaining of the pilgrimage

 process; the transformative and unitive ele- ments of both individual and institutional forms of pilgrimage; and the significance of the places and objects pilgrims encounter dur- ing their journey. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
273. Indian Philosophy Cross-listed with PHIL 275. An introduction to the classical philo- sophical tradition of India. The primary emphasis is on reading and discussion of selected Hindu and Buddhist sources in English translation, though contemporary and comparative materials also may be included. In terms of the "fields" of Western philoso- phy, the major focus is on Indian approaches to metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, with secondary consideration of logic, linguistic philosophy, and aesthetics. Some prior work in either Western philosophy or South Asian religion is highly desirable. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
276. Religious Autobiography in Comparative Perspective The course explores the lives of persons who have intensely pursued self- knowledge and the knowledge of God or ulti- mate reality. Through close attention to the insights offered by individual experience and by knowledge of dynamic religious traditions such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, the course studies the personal quest for meaning and its debt to diverse ideas and beliefs. The course approaches religious autobiography as the product of a mutually creative interplay between religious tradition and the search for spiritual insight and sense of purpose. Authors include Augustine, Thoreau, Gandhi, M.L. King, Mernissi and Basho. 6 credist, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.

320. Conscience and Community: Challenges in Catholic Moral Theology How are contempo- rary Roman Catholics forming their con- sciences on disputed moral questions? How does a religious tradition accommodate diver- sity and change and also maintain unity and continuity? Such questions will inform this seminar, which will consider debates on bioethics, feminism, authority and dissent, sexuality and reproduction, and ecology. Prerequisite: One course in ethics or Christianity, or consent of the instructor. 6 credits, HU, Fall-A. Patrick
321. Kierkegaard This seminar consists of read- ing in works by S0ren Kierkegaard (1813- 1855) that are concerned with his pseudonymity and indirect communication, i.e. his strategies and arguments that inform his depiction of the aesthetic, ethical, and reli- gious spheres of human existence. Emphasis is placed on (a) ways of reading Kierkegaard, and (b) trying to grasp the Danish writer's significance for contemporary philosophy of religion, literary criticism, psychoanalysis, and Christian theology. 6 credits, HU, Fall Ñ R. Crouter
322. Christian Feminist Theologies Cross-listed with WGST 322. Since the early 1970s femi- nist scholars have made important contribu- tions to Christian theology, especially in the areas of biblical studies, systematic theology, and ethics.

323. Religion, Reason and Romanticism This seminar examines the roots of the debate between the Enlightenment and Romanticism within Western religious thought. Seminal works by Mendelssohn, Lessing, Kant, Schleiermacher, Feuerbach, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche are read and analyzed against the background of modern Judaic and Protestant Christian thought in modern Germany (roughly between 1770-1870). Attention is given to the rational critique and defense of religion, to distinctively modern notions of religion, and to the rise of historical and anti- historical interpretations of religion. Prerequisites: One course in Religion or Judaism or Christianity, or one course in Philosophy. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001- 2002.
327. Genesis This course will address two cen- tral concerns through an in-depth study of the book of Genesis: hermeneutics-the problems and possibilities of textual interpretation, and theology-the ways in which religious commu- nities and individuals reflect on the meaning of sacred events. This important biblical book raises an extraordinary range of issues, includ- ing cosmogony, the nature of humankind, faith, familial relationships, politics, sex and violence. Materials will be drawn from both classical and modern commentaries, including Bill Mover's series on PBS. 6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
328. Contemporary Jewish Thought This semi- nar introduces students to contemporary (Post-World War II) Jewish theology. We will explore the creative and diverse ways in which modern Jewish thinkers have combined ele- ments of modernity (e.g. the emphasis on autonomy and freedom) with traditional
Jewish beliefs about God, revelation, and redemption. The course will include represen- tative selections from rationalists and mystics, feminists, traditionalists and post-modernists. Prior study of religion and/or philosophy will be helpful. 6 credits, HU, Spring - L. Newman
330. Islamic Aesthetics A survey of Islamic artistic expression designed to introduce stu- dents to the aesthetic environment that has been a fundamental aspect of Islamic civiliza- tion over its whole history. We will consider case studies' from various Islamic societies to appreciate both the continuity of aesthetic themes across Islamic civilization and the con- siderable diversity of artistic activity stem- ming from social, cultural, and linguistic differences. Drawing from Arab, Persian, Turkish, and South Asian cultural contexts, we will focus on the following topics: con- cepts of beauty, literature in poetry and prose, architecture, miniature painting, music, and film. Prerequisite: One course in Religion or Art History, or permission of instructor. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Fall - S. Bashir
346. Healing and Religion in America Illness and health have been central concerns of a wide variety of American religious traditions. Religious traditions of healing have some- times complemented, sometimes challenged the professionalization of medicine in their unique ways of imagining the intimate rela- tions of body, mind, and spirit and of individ- ual body, social body, and the cosmos. Against the historical backdrop of the professionaliza- tion of medicine, this course explores ritual healing in Native American, Afro-Caribbean, and Asian-American communities, Mexican American curanderismo, hygienic movements, Christian Science, and faith healing. Prerequisites: Religion 110, 140, or 141, or consent of the instructor, 6 credits, HU, RAD, Winter -M.McNally

 355. Buddhist Ethics An inquiry into the nature of "the good," "the virtuous," and "the meri- torious" in Buddhism. Drawing on both tra- ditional texts and modern studies, we will examine Buddhist evocations of the ideal attainment, taxonomies of positive and nega- tive mental states, descriptive and prescriptive theories of karma, expositions of proper monastic and lay conduct, and analyses of the complex relation between knowledge and action. Examples will be taken from four major Buddhist traditions: Theravada, Indian Mahayana, Tantra, and Zen. Study of classical views will be supplemented by explorations of the ways in which Buddhist ethics may be understood in relation to ethical theories developed in the West, and to such "contem- porary" concerns as bio-ethics, the environ- ment, nationalism, and gender and sexuality.
6 credits, HU, Not offered in 2001-2002.
356. Buddhism, Belief and Religious Authority The Buddhist tradition is frequently touted, by both traditional and modern advocates, as grounded in reason as opposed to faith. Yet many, if not most, Buddhists also adamantly insist on the necessity of accepting past and future lives, while others proclaim the need for generating faith in a qualified religious guide. In this seminar, we examine a variety of Buddhist sources on the question of the limits and capacities of reason in Buddhism, asking whether and how faith and religious authority may participate in the adoption of Buddhist beliefs. Prerequisite: one course in Buddhism or consent of instructor. 6 credits, HU, RAD, Spring - S. McClintock

 228 ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES
ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES
The major in Romance Languages and Literatures is a demanding program of study for students with a solid background in both French and Spanish. It strives to provide students with a high level of proficiency in two important languages, with broad awareness of cultural contexts in Spanish speaking and Francophone lands, and with keen critical skills for literary and cultural analysis. Ideally, students will engage in cross-cultural study, or studies involving comparative literary approaches. Admission to the program is by application.
Requirements for a Major:
A Romance Languages major may be designed in cooperation with two advisors from the department, one from each language. Admission to the major will depend on the acceptance, by the department, of a written proposal outlining the student's program of study. The major requires a minimum of 72 credits, including Spanish 205 or 206 and French 309, at least 30 credits in one language (a minimum of 12 of these credits must be taken on campus or on a Carleton language program) and at least 18 in the other (a minimum of 6 of these credits must be taken on campus or on a Carleton language program) and Literary and Cultural Studies 245, with this last course normally taken during the junior year. Courses 101, 102, 103, and 204 do not count toward the major. Students are strongly encouraged to participate in one or more pro- grams of study abroad. During their senior year students write an integrative exercise, which they may accomplish under one or the other of the models designed by the French and Spanish programs (see these programs for a full description, or consult with the department).
French (FREN)
Chair: Professor Becky J. Boling
Professors: Scott D. Carpenter, Cherif KeTta, Dana J. Strand, Cathy M. Yandell Associate Professor: £va Posfay
Visiting Assistant Professor: Scott Andrew Homier
Lecturer: Christine Lac
Senior Lecturer: Cynthia Luck Shearer
Visiting Lecturer: Annick Fritz-Smead
Language Courses:
Language courses 101, 102, 103, 204 are a sequential series of courses designed to prepare the student in the basic language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) through the study of grammar, literature, and culture, and/or to provide the foundation for pursuing advanced work in language and literature. French 206 and 209 are designed to develop the stu- dent's spoken and written mastery of the language through compositions and intensive oral work based on cultural and literary topics. Admission to these courses is determined either by appropriate high school CEEB or Carleton placement test scores or by completion of the previ- ous course in the sequence with a grade of C- or better.
Literature Courses:
We examine literary works for both their aesthetic and human values. Our literature courses have a number of goals: to refine and expand students' linguistic ability, to broaden their cul-

 ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES - FRENCH 229
tural understanding, to improve their ability to engage in literary analysis, to enhance their knowledge of literary history and criticism, and to help students better understand themselves and the human condition. In our discussions, we address universal themes and concerns, but we also try to uncover what is peculiarly French or Francophone about the works.
Requirements for a French Major:
Sixty-six credits including French 309, Literary and Cultural Studies 245 (usually in the junior year), French 398-399 (usually in the senior year), and the integrative exercise, French 400. Courses 101, 102, 103, 204 do not count toward the major. The sixty-six credits must include thirty-six credits at the 300 level (French 398, 399, or 400 does not count in this category). All courses taught in French on the Paris and Mali programs count for the major, as well as French 238 from the Pau program. In addition to the sixty-six credits in the major, six credits are required in literature outside the major, read in the original language or in translation.
Concentration: See separate section for French and Francophone Studies.
Programs Abroad: Participation in a Carleton or in another approved foreign study program is highly recommended for students majoring or concentrating in the above areas. Students inter- ested in study abroad should consult the section on international off-campus programs, and dis- cuss alternatives with faculty in French and with the Director of Off-Campus Studies.
Certificate of Advanced Study in Foreign Language and Literature or Foreign Language and Area Studies: In order to receive the Certificate of Advanced Study in French, students must fulfill the general requirements (refer to Academic Regulations) in the following course distribution: six courses completed with a grade of C- or better in French beyond 103, including at least two upper-level literature courses (300-395). No more than 12 credits from non-Carleton off-campus studies programs may be applied toward the certificate.
Language Houses: Students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the language by liv- ing in the Language House. The Associate is a native speaker, and students organize and partici- pate in numerous cultural activities in the language houses.
French Courses
101,102. Elementary French The goals of these courses are: a) to learn to speak, read, write and understand the fundamental structures of French grammar and vocabulary; b) to learn to create with the French language and express your thoughts in essentially correct French prose; c) to acquire an initial awareness of French and Francophone cultures. 6 credits, ND, Fall, Winter Ñ Staff

206. Composition and Conversation Cross-listed with FRST 206. Designed to encourage stu- dents to express themselves orally and in writ- ing while strengthening their knowledge of

 230 ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES - FRENCH
contemporary French through discussions of current issues in France, A wide range of top- ics and activities will allow students to func- tion in diverse situations from practical tasks to much more specialized language situations. Students will learn useful and practical strate- gies for improving effective communication and refining their own writing style. Prerequisite: French 204 or equivalent. 6 cred- its, ND, Spring - Staff
207. Mali Program: Composition and Conversation Cross-listed with FRST 207. Since the official language of Mali is French, this course is aimed at strengthening the ability of the students to discuss, orally and in writing, topics related to life in Mali and in other
West African countries. They will read articles form the Malian press and report on radio/TV programs and other cultural events. 6 credits, ND, Winter-C.Keita
208. Paris Program: Conversation and Composition Cross-listed with FRST 208. Focusing on topics of current interest in French society, this course is designed to help students speak and write French with grace and ease. It will be taught by a local instruc- tor with the assistance of graduate students in FLE (French as a Foreign Language) from the University of Paris. The course will include both in-class activities and tutorials. 6 credits, AL, Spring Ñ Non-Carleton Faculty
233. The French Cinema Cross-listed with MEDA 241* In this overview of the major trends in French cinema, we will consider the intersec- tions of the political, social, cultural, and artistic dimensions of films by Renoir, Truffaut, Godard, Varda, Chabrol, and others. Discussions will focus on such questions as
the following: In what ways has French cin- ema mobilized (or undermined) national myths? How have films established and medi-
ated French historical memory? How have French films dealt with the nation's (colonial) others? Course materials will incorporate criti- cal theory and cultural readings. Taught in English with all films subtitled. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
235. Francophone Literature of Africa and the Caribbean Cross-listed with AFAM 235. Reading and discussion of literary works, with analysis of social, historical and political issues. Conducted in English. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
238. Border Crosings: Postmodern Perspectives
on French and German Cinema Refer to MEDA 238 for description. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
240. Introduction to French and Francophone Literatures: Dreams of Trespass Cross-listed with FRST 240. From sweet-talking medieval troubadours to free-spirited Moroccan harem women, French and Francophone literature offers fascinating glimpses of what happens when we dare to flirt with the forbidden. In this survey course, we will explore the trans- gressive acts imagined by such authors as Fatima Mernissi, George Sand, Gustave Flaubert (along with his cinematographic interpreter, Claude Chabrol), Tahar Ben
Jelloun and Jean Genet. Conducted in French. 6 credits, AL, Fall - D. Strand
241. Introduction to French and Francophone Literatures: "Invitation au Voyage" Cross-listed with FRST 241. From Rabelais to Le Petit Prince, the voyage has been a compelling force in the French literary imagination. This course will explore the question of the voyage in French and Francophone literature, film and music. What does it mean to go else- where (both literally and figuratively)? Through travel or displacement how are both

 the self and the other redefined? These are the sorts of questions we will discuss, through lit- erary works of Montaigne, Voltaire, Madame de Grafigny, Baudelaire, Gide, Sebbar and Duras; recent films of Te'chine' and Varda; and selected contemporary songs. Conducted in French. Prerequisite: French 204 or equiva- lent. 6 credits, AL, Spring - C. Yandell
243. Topics in Cultural Studies: Language and Identity in France and the Francophone World Cross-listed with FRST 243. We will take a sociolinguistic approach to the study of French culture as we focus on the parallel evo- lution of the French language and the society that produced it and was created by it. After examining the concept of French identity from an historical and linguistic perspective, we will analyze specific elements of that iden- tity in the contemporary world, notably, edu- cation, regionalism, postcolonialism (within and outside of France), and the influence of Europe and the U.S.A. We will look at movies, songs, cartoons, recipes, toys, short stories, essays and other types of cultural arti- facts as the object of our study. Conducted in French. Prerequisite: French 204 or equiva- lent. 6 credits, AL, Winter - C. Lac
245. Francophone Literature of Africa and the Caribbean Cross-listed with AFAM 245 and FRST 245. Reading and discussion of literary works, with analysis of social, historical and political issues. Conducted in French. Prerequisite: French 204 or equivalent. 6 cred- its, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
246. Paris Program: City of Visions: Paris in the Arts Cross-listed with FRST 242. Home of some of the finest and best-known museums in the world, Paris has long been a recognized center for artistic activity. Students will have the opportunity to study first-hand French art of the last two centuries through classroom
study and guided visits to the unparalleled collections at the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay and other celebrated museums. Conducted in French. 6 credits, AL, Spring - Non-Carleton Faculty
248. African Cinema: In Search of Identity and Self Definition Cross-listed with AFAM 247 and MEDA 247. This course will introduce stu- dents (who are not expected to have an exten- sive knowledge of African history and culture) to films that engage the socio-political issues central to an emerging African cultural iden- tity. The course will focus on work by African filmmakers such as Souleymane Cisse* (whose The Brightness won the Prix du Jury at Cannes in 1987), but it will also touch on the cinemas of the diaspora-particularly in the Caribbean. In contrast, we will also consider colonial and post-colonial "definitions" of Africa from Hollywood in the '30s (where "the natives" are the ones with the spears) to France in the 70s (Jean-Jacques Arnaud's Oscar-winning Black and White in Color). 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
249. Paris Program: Reading and Writing the City Cross-listed with FRST 253. Paris is a world capital, a crossroads of cultures, classes, and languages. How does one make sense of the immense complexity of a city of this scope? "Reading and Writing the City" will study the city both within texts (literary, sociologi- cal, historical), and as a text. Drawing on sig- nifying systems as varied as maps, street signs, film, and poetry (just to give a few examples), students will learn about how and what the city means to its various "readers" and "users." An independent project will enable students to discuss a particular representation of the city, or to represent it in the medium of the student's choice. 6 credits, AL, Spring Ñ S. Carpenter
ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES - FRENCH 231

 232 ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES - FRENCH
250. Mali Program: Film, Literature and Society in Mali Cross-listed with FRST 250. This course will concentrate on the dynamics of orality, writing, and the art of cinema in Mali. The works of writers such as Amadou Hampate
Ba, Seydou Badian, Massa Makan Diabate,
and filmmakers such as Souleymane Cisse, Cheick Oumar Sissoko, and Adama Drabo
will be studied. This course will also intro- duce the students to the life and work of tra- ditional and modern performers in Mali. 6 credits, AL, Winter - C. Kei'ta
251. Mali Program: Negotiating the Past: The Challenges of Nation-building in Mali Cross-listed with FRST 249. This course will look at vari- ous issues in Malian history (ancient and mod- ern) and the process of political and economic change. A component of this course will be an introduction to conversational Bambara, the lingua franca of Mali. 4 credits, AL, Winter - Non-Carleton Faculty
290. Mali Program: Directed Reading Cross-listed with FRST 290. 2 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, Winter - C. Keita
309. Beyond Words: The Fine Art of Writing in French Cross-listed with FRST 309. Designed to help students develop strategies to master the writing of literary essays, "expose*s" and "explication de textes" in French, while per- fecting their own writing style through cre- ative writing and translation. Required for the major in French. Prerequisite: at least one course above 204. 6 credits, AL, Winter Ñ C. Lac
346. Methods of Teaching Modern World Languages Refer to EDUC 346 for descrip- tion. 6 credits, ND, Not offered in 2001-2002.
349. Paris Program: Reading and Writing the City
Cross-listed with FRST 349. Paris is a world
capital, a crossroads of cultures, classes, and languages. How does one make sense of the immense complexity of a city of this scope? "Reading and Writing the City" will study the city both within texts (literary, sociologi- cal, historical), and as a text. Drawing on sig- nifying systems as varied as maps, street signs, film, and poetry (just to give a few examples), students will learn about how and what the city means to its various "readers" and "users." An independent project will enable students to discuss a particular representation of the city, or to represent it in the medium of the student's choice. Conducted in French. 6 cred- its, AL, Spring Ñ S. Carpenter
351. Topics in the Sixteenth Century: Metamorphoses: Love, War and Monsters in Early Modern France Cross-listed with FRST 351. The French Renaissance continues to intrigue students and critics by its propensity for paradox, ambiguity, and contradiction.
Just as literature and the arts reached new lev- els of aesthetic achievement, the bloodiest civil war in French history was taking shape. Simultaneously producing lyric poetry prais- ing beautiful bodies, bawdy tales, moralizing dialogue, and chronicles of monsters, French sixteenth-century culture was in a constant state of flux. Through such authors as Rabelais, Marguerite de Navarre, Ronsard, Louise Labe* and Montaigne, as well as con- temporaneous artistic and musical works, we will investigate the meaning of these meta- morphoses. Recommended preparation: 240 or equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
352. Seventeenth-Century Literature: Eccentrics in Classical France Cross-listed with FRST 352. Seventeenth century France is often touted as the pinnacle of French grandeur. Under Louis XIVs absolutist rule, France supported an astounding number of normative measures-

 from founding academies to policing codes of behavior-designed to help the French nation
to become a political, economic and cultural world power. But in the midst of all these pressures towards normativeness, could one express any dissent in the age of Versailles?
We will explore the creative strategies used in a whole range irreverent writings by of Moliere, Racine, Perrault, Lafayette, Choisy and many more. Conducted in French. Recommended preparation: 240-level course
or equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Spring - $.. Posfay
354. Literature of the Other Cross-listed with FRST 354. What is the division between Us and Them? The way we define the groups we belong to and those we differ from has always been of capital importance, and these defini- tions change over time. By looking at texts and events of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including travel literature, tales of the supernatural, texts from the Revolution and documents of colonization, we will inves- tigate the creation and manipulation of vari- ous "Others," as they have been defined socially, culturally, and sexually. Authors may include Mme de Graffigny, Diderot, Sade, Mme de Stael, Balzac, Flaubert, Baudelaire, among others. Conducted in French. Recommended preparation: 240-level course or equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Winter - S. Carpenter
357. Modern French Poetry Cross-listed with FRST 357. How does a poem mean? We will address this question in the light of nine- teenth and twentieth-century French poetry. This is a dynamic period, one which witnesses a series of poetic revolutions: classical verse, forms, and esthetics shatter under the weight of new understandings of language. Authors studied include Lamartine, Hugo, Baudelaire, Siefert, Mallarme, Valery, Apollinaire, Eluard, Ponge, and more. Topics will include literary
movements (e.g., Romanticism, Symbolism, Surrealism), lyrical forms (from the sonnet to the picture-poem to free verse), and such key notions as mimesis the unconscious, and the function of language. Conducted in French. Recommended preparation: 240-level course or equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
358. Twentieth-Century Literature: Theater of Derision Cross-listed with FRST 358. Derisive laughter echoes hauntingly throughout much of modern French theater, challenging both the spectator's self-complacency and the play's unquestioned representation of the real. In this course, we will explore the subversive effects that techniques of derision have on the theatrical experience in the works of such innovative twentieth century playwrights as Sartre, Beckett, Vian, and Genet. Conducted in French. Prerequisite: at least one course above the 240-level or equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
359. Twentieth-Century Literature: The Novel and Memory Cross-listed with FRST 359. Marcel Proust's quest to retrieve the past set the stage for future writers who, in their turn, have undertaken the challenging task of prob- ing what bell hooks has referred to as "the debris of history." Memory, whether real or imagined, experiential or experimental, has been a central concern in the works of such twentieth-century authors as Maguerite Duras, Patrick Modiano, Charlotte Delbo, and Albert Camus. In this course we will pay par- ticular attention to the high stakes of remem- bering (and forgetting) at the intersection of story (personal) and history (collective). Taught in French. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
395. Writing and Identity Cross-listed with FRST 395. Drawing upon autobiographical writings
ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES - FRENCH 233

 234 ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES - FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES
from French and Francophone traditions, this course will address questions of culture and identity (personal, familial, national, ethnic and sexual). Authors may include Montaigne, Rousseau, Sartre, Sarraute, Agag, Bugul, Guibert and Ernaux. To complement these lit- erary and theoretical considerations, students will engage in their own autobiographical projects throughout the class. Conducted in French. Recommended preparation: French 240 or equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Fall -C. Yandell
398. Senior Essay The planning, preparation and writing of a significant paper in French or French and Francophone Studies under the direction of the department. Devoted to for-
mulating a thesis and establishing a critical bibliography. 3 credits, S/CR/NC, ND, Fall - D. Strand

Requirements for a French and Francophone Studies Major:
The French and Francophone Studies program responds to the growing interest in cultural studies, Africana and post-colonial studies by combining in the best possible way the resources of various disciplinary approaches including literature, political science, history, anthropology, and arts. After acquiring a solid grounding in the language, students will embark on the study of topics such as French cultural theory, issues of identity, social change, nationalism, and gen- der in France and the francophone societies in Canada, Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia.
The major in French and Francophone Studies follows the general outlines of the French and Francophone Studies Concentration with a total of 27 additional credits in coursework and sen- ior requirements.
I. Language competence:
Prerequisite: French 204. In order to handle the sophisticated materials in French covered in our departmental courses and in order to be able to conduct research in French, where appropri- ate, in the courses offered outside the French section, it is highly recommended that students take French language classes above the 204-level. Examples: French 206, 208, 209 and 309.
II. One supporting course in cultural studies (see under concentration)
These interdisciplinary courses (FREN 243 and appropriate off-campus courses on culture) serve to introduce students to a variety of topics and techniques relevant to cultural studies.
III. One supporting course in history (see under concentration)

 ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES - FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES 235
This requirement reflects the importance of historical grounding that was previously recog- nized in the organization of the concentration.
IV. Four French language or literature courses, three of which must be at the 300-level:
Since our literature courses adopt an interdisciplinary approach, students can complement their learning in other disciplines through the literature offerings of the French section. We insist on three courses at the 300-level, because we find that the complex issues raised by the intersection of history, politics, and socio-cultural perspectives can best be explored by students who have a solid background in both language and literary studies.
V. Three elective courses appropriate for the major:
Students may choose from any of the courses included in the Concentration description, or any course appropriate for the major.
VI. The capstone seminar:
This 300-level course is an advanced interdisciplinary seminar focused on a particular topic and the methodology used for its study. It will be taught in French or English. Example: FRST 395: Mande of West Africa
VII. Comprehensive exercise:
a, French Studies 398-399: Senior Essay (Fall and Winter). A seminar focusing on the planning, preparation, and completion of a significant paper in French or Francophone
Studies under the supervision of two advisors: one from the French section (the designated comps coordinator), and one from another discipline. This exercise will normally be written in French. 3 credits per term.
b. French Studies 400: Integrative Exercise (Spring). A colloquium in which students pres- ent and defend their senior essay and discuss the essays of others. 3 credits.
A total of 69 credits are required for the major.
Majors are urged to pursue off-campus study in a French-speaking country. For information on approved international off-campus programs, consult the faculty in French and the Off- Campus Studies Office.

Language Courses:
Language courses 101, 102, 103, 204 are a sequential series of courses designed to prepare the student in the basic language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) through the study of grammar, literature, and culture, and/or to provide the foundation for pursuing advanced work in language and literature. Spanish 205, 206 and 207 are designed to develop the student's spoken and written mastery of the language through compositions and intensive oral work based on cultural and literary topics. Admission to these courses is determined either by appropriate high school CEEB or Carleton placement test scores or by completion of the pre- vious course in the sequence with a grade of C- or better.
Literature Courses:
We examine literary works for both their aesthetic and human values. Our literature courses have a number of goals: to refine and expand students' linguistic ability, to broaden their cul- tural understanding, to improve their ability to engage in literary analysis, to enhance their knowledge of literary history and criticism, and to help students better understand themselves and the human condition. In our discussions, we address universal themes and concerns, but we also try to uncover what is peculiarly Hispanic or Latin American about the works.
Requirements for a Major:
Sixty-six credits including one of the following courses (205 or 206) and Literary and Cultural Studies 245, the latter normally taken during the junior year. Courses 101, 102,

209. Madrid Program: Exploring Spanish Culture An introductory history and culture class with a strong emphasis on reading and writing. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
In our literature courses the approach is mainly literary, but with interdisciplinary dimensions. Representative works are ana- lyzed and discussed not only for their aes- thetic worth, but as human documents that speak clearly of the social, political, economic, philosophical, religious, psychological and general cultural reality of the country. In peninsular literature courses every effort is made to point out and relate these findings meaningfully to the Latin American reality, as evidence of the Spanish cultural legacy to the New World.

It will address the diversity of problems that surface depending on whether the writers are immigrants, first generation English speakers, native to the Southwest but marginalized from American culture, urban dwellers or rural pobladores, men or women, gay or straight. Since this course is offered in the Spanish section, an emphasis is placed on the problem of language (bilingualism and translation), its relation to a general American identity (American defined here as belonging to the Americas, not only the U.S.), and more broadly to what we have to understand as hybrid cultures. In English. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.

America Cross-listed with LTAM 252. We will study collections of short stories by well- known Latin American authors such as Juan Rulfo, Cristina Peri Rossi, Isabel Allende, Julio Corrazar, Jorge Luis Borges, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. How does the short story dif- fer from other narratives? What possibilities
of form and content does the short story pro- vide? We will explore how this genre repre- sents contemporary issues in Latin America even as it gives shape to the desire to tell a good story. We will tell and write our own short stories to better understand the genre. Prerequisite: Spanish 204 or proficiency. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Spring - B. Boling

320. Love and Death in Spanish Theater There are few themes in the history of Spanish the- ater that are more provocative, more fascinat- ing, or more universal than Love and Death. Both reveal life as transformation, one ecstatic, the other catastrophic, and with a certain confusion between the two as the liter- ary rule rather than the exception. In this course we shall examine a wide variety of atti- tudes toward both of these realities, begin- ning with the fifteenth-century masterpiece La Celestina and ending with a contemporary play by Buero Vallejo about Goya. Works include among others, baroque, romantic and existentialist versions of the Don Juan figure. Prerequisite: Spanish 204 or proficiency. 6 credits, AL, Winter - P. Dust
322. The Novel in Spain A study of the richness and variety of novelistic forms produced in Spain from the Renaissance to the present, dealing with either a particular period (i.e., seventeenth century, nineteenth-century Realism, the Impressionist novels of the early twentieth century, Neorealism in the Post- war Years, etc.) or adopting a comparative perspective (i.e., The Nature and Development of the Picaresque from the Sixteenth Century to the Present, Fictional Models and Historical Realities, etc.). Attention may be given to problems in the theory of the novel as well as to diachronic and stylistic considerations. Prerequisite: Spanish 204 or proficiency. 6 credits, AL, Winter -J. Brioso
324. Contemporary Spanish Poetry Close read- ing and discussion of a limited number of works by some of the most important Spanish poets in the twentieth-century including Antonio Machado, Juan Ramon Jimenez,

will be considered also. Prerequisite: Spanish 205 or the equivalent. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
330. Cervantes: Don Quijote: Hero or Fool? Few
books have made us laugh so much or reflect more deeply about human existence than Don Quijote. This masterpiece of world literature is many things: the first "novel," an apology for limitless idealism, a symbol of the spiri- tual grandeur of Renaissance Spain, a comedy, a portrait of madness, a melancholy medita- tion on human failure, a burlesque epic, a par- adox, a manual for would-be revolutionaries, a tragedy, etc. We will examine all these dimen- sions-and more-in a study of selected chapters from the book. We will learn why Don Quijote is a masterpiece and why it speaks so powerfully to later generations, including our own. Prerequisite: Spanish 204 or proficiency. 6 credits, AL, Not offered in 2001-2002.
334. Texts and Nations: Nineteenth-Century Latin America Cross-listed with LTAM 334. This course will focus on the literature writ- ten in the period following Latin American independence in the nineteenth century all
the way to the Mexican revolution. The cen- tral organizing concept will be that of the nation as an imagined community that is cre- ated discursively and is intimately bound to the functioning of the state, the creation of a national identity, and ultimately the invention of the people (with all its gender and ethnic inflections). We will examine closely different kinds of primary texts: fiction, essays, poetry, newspaper articles, manifestoes. All primary and theoretical texts will be in Spanish, Selections from: Sarmiento, Bello, Echeverria, Hernandez, Marti, Dario, del Casal, Rod<5, Gomez de Avellaneda, Matto de Turner, Machado de Assis. Prerequisite: Spanish 204

 or proficiency. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
340. Latin American Prose: Dictatorships and Revolution in the Latin American Narrative Cross-listed with LTAM 340. This course briefly examines the origins and development of the Latin American narrative and then focuses on the literary reaction to dictatorship and revolution. It stresses a critical reading and discussion of major works by Azuela, Castellanos, and Fuentes (Mexico), Asturias (Guatemala), and Allende (Chile). The empha- sis is on Mexico and the literary interpretation of the Revolution of 1910 and the society that grew out of it. Prerequisite: a 240 level litera- ture course is strongly recommended. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001-2002.
338. Spanish Images of the Indian in Spanish
American Literature Cross-listed with LTAM
338. After a historical survey of the relation-
ship between national projects of social organ-
ization and the indigenous populations of the
area, this course focuses on Indigenismo as a
set of social discourses attempting to represent
"the Indian", and on key works by Icaza
(Ecuador), Asturias (Guatemala), Arguedas
(Peru), and Castellanos (Mexico). While con-
sidering the specific literary quality of this
writing, we will contrast its representation of
"the Indian" with indigenous self-representa-
tion in oral-popular tradition and through
intellectuals like Domitila Barrios, Rigoberta
Menchu, Bernabe Condori and others, to bet-
ter understand the relationship between offi-
cial culture and its Other. Prerequisite:

336. Genealogies of the Modern: Turn of the
Century Latin America Cross-listed with LTAM
336. In this course we will examine what the
literary tradition has come to name "mod-
ernismo." We will cover the period between
1870 and 1910. We will study it in the con-
text of the experience of modernity, that is the
configuration of emergent cities, urban cul-
ture, mass media, technological innovation
and the modernization of the figure of the
writer. Particular attention will be given to
the understanding of the modern in a non-
European context and its relation to what we
know today as modern Latin American iden-
tity. Selections from: Marti, Dario, Rod6,
Gonzalez Prada, Gutierrez Ndjera, Lugones,

ciency. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Not offered in 2001- ically with issues of gender, challenging 2002.
344. Women Writers in Latin America: Challenging Gender and Genre Cross-listed with LTAM 344 and WGST 344. The course will study texts (written by women) that deal crit-
implicit and explicit patriarchal values. Emphasis will also be placed on how these women have experimented with narrative and poetic genres to express their personal con- cerns and to deconstruct orthodox structures. Authors usually included: Sor Juana Ine*s de la Cruz, Storni, Agustini, Castellanos, Poniatowska, Molloy, Valenzuela, Ferre\ Garro, Peri Rossi, Allende.

350. Recent Trends in Latin American Narrative: Pop Culture and Testimony Cross-listed with LTAM 350. Postboom narratives question the nature of telling stories, from Rigoberta Menchu's testimony to Tomas Eloy Martinez's novelistic history of Eva Perdn's embalmed body. Galeano, Alegria, Puig, Vega, and Esquivel combine fiction and reportage or recontextualize the romance and detective novels. Emerging with these narratives is the ecological novel which refashions the standard Latin American theme of "civilizaci6n y bar- baric" What makes these texts literature? How has the craft of author changed, and what constitutes a postmodern narrative dis- course? Prerequisite: a 240 or 300 level litera- ture course is recommended. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Fall -B. Boling
360. Topics in Hispanic Literature: Difference, Identity and Representation in Latin America Cross-listed with LTAM 360. Identity diversifi- cation is an ongoing process in Latin America, resulting from conflictive interactions
between heterogeneous social groups, among which power is unevenly distributed. This course examines the ways in which literature incorporates specific manifestations of ethnic, racial, sexual, and gender difference against
the background of territorial-geological, cul- tural, political and economic fragmentation of this region in the period 1950-2000. To examine specific forms of literary experimen- tation, narrative and poetry will be considered in relation to oral tradition, popular music, film, video and other cultural artifacts pro- duced in such a heterogeneous context. Focus on Peruvian and Colombian literatures and cultures. Prerequisite: Spanish 204 or profi- ciency. 6 credits, AL, RAD, Spring -J. Cerna- Bazdn
360. Topics in Hispanic Literature: Sex With God: Mystic Writers in Spain and Latin America Cross- listed with LTAM 360. An orgasm of the soul, mysticism can be described as an erotic rela- tionship with God which shatters language and the self. This course examines the literary works by some of the greatest mystic writers in Spain and Latin America from the XVI century to the present. We will begin by looking at the writings of Theresa de Avila, John of the Cross, and Miguel de Molinos, and then move on to explore the impact of mysticism on contemporary Latin American literature, including Octavio Paz and Ernesto Cardenal. Prerequisite: Spanish 205 or equiva- lent. 6 credits, AL, Fall - H. Huergo

SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY (SOAN)
Chair: Professor James F. Fisher
Professors: James F. Fisher, Beverly Nagel, Nader Saiedi, Nancy C. Wilkie Visiting Professors: Naran Bilik, Michael R. Leming
Associate Professors: Pamela Feldman-Savelsberg, Jerome M. Levi
Assistant Professor: Annette Nierobisz
Visiting Instructor: Javier Morillo-Alicea
Joining two disciplines as it does, the Sociology and Anthropology Department at Carleton seeks to present a truly unified vision of them, both in the major as a whole and in many of the individual courses. Our principal goal is to give students a comparative perspective on human societies, exploring the vast range of similarities and differences among them in space and time.
Non-majors may take either 110 or 111. We strongly recommend, however, that students considering a major in the department take both of them (in either order) by the end of the sophomore year. Unless otherwise noted, 110 or 111 is prerequisite for courses numbered 200 and above, though juniors and seniors lacking the prerequisite may apply to the instructor for permission to enroll.
Requirements for a Major:
Sixty-six credits in the department, including 110, 111, 240, 330, 331 and 400. Students should plan on taking the theory courses, 330 and 331, and the research methods course, 240 in their junior year. The integrative exercise is spread out over the senior year, with most of the work falling in winter term. A maximum of 12 credits can be applied toward the major from relevant courses in off-campus programs.
In keeping with our philosophy of comparative studies and commitment to understanding human societies other than the one we live in, majors are required to carry out an in depth study of a culture other than their own. This may be done in conjunction with regular courses, through independent study, or on off-campus programs. Plans for completing this requirement should be discussed with the student's advisor early in the junior year.

an anthropological approach to the study of
comparative religion. What is the relationship
between "myth" and "history?" How do ani-
mals, food, color, music, and the human body
function as idioms of symbolic communica-
tion? Why is ritual credited with the ability
to heal illnesses, offer political commentary,
maintain cosmic harmony, and foster social
cohesion through the exhibition of interper-
sonal tensions? Examining major theories in

The Women's and Gender Studies Program provides an interdisciplinary meeting ground for exploring questions about women and gender that are transforming knowledge across discipli- nary lines in the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Its goal is to include gender, along with class, sexual orientation and race, as a central category of social and cultural analysis. Courses focusing on women are offered by the departments of Asian Languages and Literatures, Classics, English, German and Russian, Romance Languages and Literatures, History, Media Studies, Music, Religion, Philosophy, Political Science, Art, Sociology and Anthropology, as well as Women's and Gender Studies itself. Carleton offers both a Major and a Concentration in Women's and Gender Studies that allows students to complement their major field with an interdisciplinary focus on women and gender. All courses are open to all students, if they have fulfilled the prerequisites.
Women's and Gender Studies 110, an entry point to the major, is a topical introduction to the field. Women's and Gender Studies 200 provides the theoretical and methodological tools for advanced work on women and gender. The capstone course, Women's and Gender Studies 396, offers students the opportunity to study a topic in depth and to produce a substantial research paper. The major culminates in a senior comprehensive project, directed by advisors from two disciplines, that builds on the skills and interests developed in previous coursework in Women's and Gender Studies. Each student devises an appropriate program of courses in consul- tation with the major advisor.
WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES 261

 262 WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
Requirements for a Major: (Total of 66 credits)
One introductory course, Women's and Gender Studies 110
One methodology course, Women's and Gender Studies 200
One Capstone Seminar, Women's and Gender Studies 396
Comprehensive Exercise, Women's and Gender Studies 400
In addition to these 24 credits, students must complete an additional 42 credits from the Women's and Gender Studies offerings listed below. Of these 42, no more than 12 credits should be at the 100-level and at least 12 credits should be at the 300-level. Ordinarily, no more than 18 credits may be applied to the major from outside of Carleton.
Students will plan these courses in consultation with the Program Director or a designated Faculty Advisor when they declare their major, and review their plan each term. The major they design should provide both breadth of exposure to Women's and Gender Studies across fields
and depth of study in one discipline (normally department).
Women's and Gender Studies Courses
110. Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies This course is an introduction to the ways in which gender structures our world, to theories of women's oppression and liberation, and to the ways feminist thought challenges established intellectual frameworks.

Drawing on historically rele- vant and recent work in literature, anthropol- ogy, philosophy, psychology and other disciplines, we will explore a variety of para- digms for the construction of sexuality (e.g., bisexual, heterosexual, lesbian, gay male) and examine the complex ways in which different modes of representation shape and, in turn, are shaped by these sexualities. Attention will be paid to the impact of race, class and ethnic- ity on configurations of sexuality. 6 credits, HU, SpringÑJ.Manion

Other Programs for Off-Campus Study
In addition to those programs above which Carleton sponsors or co-sponsors, students can select from over 60 additional pre-approved programs for general participation, or they can request approval for an unaffiliated program which the student and her/his academic advisor believe will further the student's educational goals. Students whose off-campus study program are approved in advance by the College may earn up to 54 credits (one year's worth) to be applied to their Carleton degree. Students are encouraged to learn more about off-campus study opportunities and information about specific programs by visiting the Off-Campus Studies Office in Laird 131.

 PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION
Preparation for Professional Schools: The Carleton curriculum does not provide programs which are recommended for all students intending to enter a particular professional school upon com- pletion of their B.A. degree. Although there are no special programs designated as pre-law, pre- medicine, pre-ministerial, and so on, Carleton does have a pre-law and a pre-med advisor; each year many Carleton graduates continue their education in various professional schools. Rather, at Carleton a regular program of studies in one of the established major fields is generally recom- mended as the best preparation for further training. In consultation with their faculty advisors and the department chair, students can arrange a program of study which best suits their own needs and objectives, without restriction to one program which is adjudged the best for all cir- cumstances and cases.
Students planning to enter any of the professions listed below should see the chair of their department and the appropriate pre-professional advisor. The staff at the Career Center can pro- vide assistance to students who are seeking more information about these career fields as well as internship and summer job information related to these careers. The following comments may be helpful for those who plan to specialize later.
ARCHITECTURE: Graduate schools of architecture do not require a specific major but most require or recommend drawing (ARTS 110, see also ARTS 113 and 210), calculus (Mathematics 111, see also 121), and physics (Physics 112 or two of the following three-credit courses: either 113 or 114, followed by 115). A portfolio of visual materials is also required; students may want to take additional courses in studio art in order to build up their portfolio. Courses in the history of art and architecture are further recommended. For information consult the chair of the Department of Art and Art History.
BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT: Carleton does not offer courses in business and governmental administration, yet a large proportion of its graduates seek and obtain careers in the manage- ment of business firms, government agencies, and non-profit enterprises such as hospitals, schools, fine arts centers, etc. Potential employers as well as graduate schools of business, and public policy law, urge students to take several courses in economics and selected courses in mathematics, especially computer programming and statistics. Interested students can discuss careers in these fields with the chair or any member of the economics department.
CHEMISTRY: The American Chemical Society recommends the following courses for certification: Chemistry 123, 230, 233, 234, 343, 344, 304, 305, 306, 351, 352 and two more advanced courses plus research experience.
DENTISTRY: See Medicine below.
EDUCATION: Preparation for Careers in Public Education: In most states, teaching licensure is a basic requirement for a career in public education, whether as a classroom teacher, administrator, counselor, librarian, or in a variety of supervisory positions. Students planning a teaching career
PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION 271

 272 PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION
in public education should consult a member of the Educational Studies Department early in their first year.
Programs leading to secondary teaching licenses are available at Carleton in the areas of: communication arts (English), world languages (French, German, Russian, Spanish), mathemat- ics, science (life, physical, earth), and social studies (American studies, African/African American studies, economics, history, government, psychology, religion and sociology) and visual arts.
Elementary licensure at Carleton is available only in art. For other fields students may com- plete their chosen major and then meet professional requirements for licensure through a fifth year at another institution, usually earning a master's degree in elementary education.
The teacher education program at Carleton College is accredited by the Minnesota Department of Children, Families, and Learning and is in full compliance with Federal Title II regulations for disclosure of state mandated examination pass rates. For 1999-2000 the Carleton licensure candidates pass rates were 100% for all areas; a detailed disclosure statement is avail- able from the Educational Studies Department Office on request.
Carleton-Bank Street Program in Elementary Education: During their junior year, Carleton stu- dents may apply to the Bank Street College of Education for admission to its Master of Science program in elementary education. Following their junior year, students will take two July sum- mer session courses at Bank Street, then return to Carleton to complete their senior year. After receiving their B.A. from Carleton, they will return to Bank Street to complete their M.S. in education and requirements for New York State elementary licensure. Students interested in this program should speak to the chair of the Educational Studies Department no later than the spring of their sophomore year.
ENGINEERING: A Combined Plan in Engineering is offered in cooperation with Columbia University and with Washington University (St. Louis). Under this plan a student combines three years of study at Carleton with two years at one of the collaborating institutions. After completion of the five-year program, the student is awarded two degrees, a B.A. degree from Carleton and a B.S. degree from the engineering school. Students majoring in chemistry, mathe- matics, or physics are eligible for participation in this program, provided they plan early in their college careers to complete those courses at Carleton which are necessary for admission to one of these schools at the end of three years. All Carleton proficiency and distribution requirements must be met, and the integrative exercise in the major field must be completed during the jun- ior year. In an effort to broaden the engineering opportunities similar programs have been approved on an individual basis at other engineering schools with national reputations and with academic expectations similar to Carleton's.
Information concerning the Combined Plan in Engineering may be obtained from Nelson Christensen, Department of Physics and Astronomy. Students who expect to pursue this option should consult with him as early as possible in their college careers to make certain that their programs of study are suitable.
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION OR HEALTH SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT: The Carleton degree can pro- vide the requisite background for graduate degree programs in these areas in schools of public health or for special programs in some schools of business administration. Interested students

 should contact the chair of the Advisory Committee on Health Professions Programs or the Career Center.
JOURNALISM AND PUBLISHING: After receiving a B.A. degree, students can obtain an M.A. in journalism after one year in a professional school. Many newspaper and magazine editors prefer to employ beginners with experience on college publications and a broad liberal arts education. Students who wish to become journalists are advised to take courses in economics, history, polit- ical science and English. Prospective journalists are strongly advised to write for The Carletonian and for other campus publications, to work for other newspapers and magazines during the summer, and to seek out internships on newspapers and magazines and in publishing houses, all of which offer ample opportunity for students to obtain practical experience.
LAW: Most important for law school admission is the development of skills of expression, logic, and verbal and quantitative analysis. What major the student chooses in order to acquire and improve these skills is unimportant. Law schools typically look for a variety of backgrounds and majors among their applicants.
A Combined Plan in Law is offered in cooperation with the Columbia University School of Law. Under this plan a student combines three years of study at Carleton with three years at Columbia Law School. After completion of the six year program, the student is awarded two degrees, a B.A. degree from Carleton and a J.D. degree from Columbia. Admission is limited to about two persons per year. Information on the combined plan may be obtained from the Pre- Law advisor, Kimberly Smith. Application should be made early in the junior year.
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE: A master's degree from a school of library and information science accredited by the American Library Association is the normal credential needed by those planning a career in librarianship. The B.A. degree with a broad general background in the arts and sciences is the best preparation for graduate study in library and information science. Any undergraduate major is acceptable, however there is a particular demand for people with science backgrounds. For a career in academics libraries, a second subject masters is highly recom- mended and a Ph.D. is highly desirable. Librarians who are well equipped to help shape the hybrid digital library, comprised of an increasingly rich mix of information media and genres, are in great demand. Coursework and practical experience in computer/information science, and facility with all manner of software used in creating, retrieving, manipulating, and presenting information is highly valued. Students with an interest in librarianship can gain practical expe- rience through a wide variety of student jobs in the College library, and as Fifth Year Interns.
MEDICINE: It is suggested that students discuss questions relating to preparation for medical training with the chair of the Advisory Committee on Health Professions Programs. Most stu- dents who plan to enter medicine, veterinary medicine, or dentistry major in a science, but a major in any field is acceptable to most medical, veterinary medical, or dental schools, provid- ing certain basic science courses are included. The specific requirements of the various medical schools are listed in Medical School Admissions Requirements. A copy of this book and other med- ical school information can be found in the Career Center Library.
PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION 273

 274 PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION
MINISTRY: Theological seminaries advocate a broad general background with courses in lan- guages, philosophy, social science, English, sciences, and religion.
NURSING: Carleton is a participant in a cooperative 3-2 program with the Rush University College of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences in Chicago. Three years in the liberal arts and basic sciences at Carleton are followed by two years at the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Lukes Medical Center. If the requisite courses are completed in the major and other graduation requirements are met, the Carleton B.A. can be earned as well as a degree in nursing from Rush University. Applicants should see the chair of the Advisory Committee on Health Professions Programs.
SOCIAL WORK: The Council on Social Work Education has recognized the following sequence of courses at Carleton as containing social welfare content, and they are recommended for those planning a career in social work: Sociology/Anthropology 220, Class, Power and Inequality in America. Also recommended as courses related to this sequence are Psychology 250, Developmental; 252, Personality; 354, Counseling; 356, Psychopathology.

 
 
 ADMISSIONS
Admission to Carleton is based on several considerations. Of importance are superior academic achievement, as demonstrated in the applicant s school record and scores on the required entrance examinations; personal qualities and interests; participation in extracurricular activities; and potential for development as a student and a graduate of the College. The Committee on Admissions weighs all factors to insure that those students offered admission are not only ade- quately prepared for the academic work, but also will benefit from their total experience at Carleton and add significantly to the College through their individual talents and personal qual- ities.
There is no composite Carleton student. He or she possesses a variety of qualities not meas- urable in test scores: warmth, openness, a sense of humor, an active interest in social service and in community involvement, initiative, resourcefulness, motivation and personal courage. Although many applicants rank in the top tenth of their high school classes with SAT I verbal or math scores above 600, many attractive candidates do not. A sizeable number not possessing such lofty credentials are admitted in the belief that these are restrictive measures of ability and success and do not always Ñ or perhaps never Ñ assess adequately the human characteristics which are so important to the quality of a student's success in Carleton's residential liberal arts environment.
Application for Admission: Students interested in applying for admission should write to the Dean of Admissions. Each applicant is responsible for providing the admissions office with all items requested and is asked to pay a $30 service fee which partially defrays the expense of investigating records, advising applicants and providing other admissions office services. This fee is not refundable and is not credited on any subsequent bill.
Early Decision: Those who decide that Carleton is their first choice college are encouraged to apply under the Early Decision program. Early Decision is a commitment to attend if accepted. Students may submit applications to other colleges or universities, but not under another early decision plan. Those accepted will be expected to withdraw all other applications.
Early Decision candidates are reviewed at two different times of the year, but whenever the student applies, the criteria for selection are identical. Students electing the Early Decision option should submit all necessary materials by one of the following dates:
a) November 15. The Admissions Committee will mail decisions by December 15 and admitted candidates will have until January 15 to submit the $200 confirming deposit.
b) January 15. The Admissions Committee will mail decisions by February 15 and admitted candidates will have until March 1 to submit the $200 confirming deposit.
Regular Decision: Applicants on Regular Decision will receive notification from the College by April 15 of the senior year. Those offered admission will have until May 1 to make the $200 deposit.

f Applicants requesting consideration for financial aid must also complete and file the FAFSA as soon as their parents have completed their 2001 Federal income tax returns.
Except for students electing the monthly payment plan, another $400 is due June 1 to com- plete the required advance payment. Neither the initial $200 payment nor the June payment will be refunded except in case of illness which makes it impossible for a student to enter the College at the time for which he or she has been accepted.
Late Applicants: Students who submit applications postmarked after January 15 each year must recognize they are applying on a space-if-available basis. In some years, the College is able to offer admission to late applicants; in other years, the first-year student class may be filled and students to whom we would like to offer admission must be placed on a waiting list to see if vacancies occur in late spring or early summer.
Early Admission: Each year, a number of students apply for admission following the junior year of high school. Some may be graduating early, others may be willing to forego the senior year to begin college early. The College welcomes such applications with the following understanding: Successful Early Admission candidates almost always display a high degree of social and emo- tional maturity, present unusually strong academic credentials and have exhausted their second- ary school curricular possibilities.
Deferred Admission: Candidates who wish to defer college for a year following completion of sec- ondary school may apply for admission during their senior year. The application should be accompanied by a statement describing the candidate's reasons for desiring to delay matricula- tion, plans for the interim year and perceived benefits of the delay. Such requests should be made by May 1 if at all possible.

 Transfer Students: Carleton accepts a number of transfer students for each fall term. A few may also be admitted for winter term. Students wishing to apply for the fall term should submit applications prior to March 31, and will be notified of the Admissions Committee's decision before May 15. All transfer applicants are expected to submit results from the College Board's SAT I or the American College Test. To qualify for the Carleton degree, students must spend at least two years in residence including the senior year.
Requirements for Admission: The strongest candidates for admission to Carleton have taken four years of English, three or more years of mathematics, two or more years of science and three or more years of social science. At a minimum, applicants should have three or more years of English (with a stress on writing), at least two years of algebra and a year of geometry, two years of social science and one year of a laboratory science. Most Carleton students go well beyond this minimum, and the Admissions Committee is usually attracted to candidates who take advan- tage of the opportunity to do honors or advanced placement work. Normally, students will be expected to take two or more years of a foreign or classical language unless it is not offered in the school. The greater the number of courses in the subjects listed above, the more the appli- cant's qualifications for admission are strengthened. An applicant of unusual ability and interest whose secondary school program does not include all of these courses may be granted admission on the basis of his or her school record, the scores on standardized tests, and the recommenda- tions of school officials.
Carleton recognizes achievement in the arts and encourages students to submit slides, tapes, or other evidence of their work with their application.
Admissions Testing: Believing that the Admissions Committee is best able to make sound judg- ments about candidates' academic abilities when the secondary school record is supplemented by the results of standardized examinations. Carleton requires each applicant to submit results of the SAT I or the American College Test (ACT) prior to admission. The PSAT/NMSQT may be substituted in lieu of the SAT I or the ACT if Carleton is the only college requiring the latter examination. Further, we recommend but do not require, that candidates submit the results of their SAT II: subject tests, formerly called Achievement Tests. We have found these tests valu- able aids in the assessment of the quality of student achievement in a wide variety of secondary school programs. It has been our experience that SAT II test results usually enhance a candi- date's credentials and only rarely constitute a negative factor.
Students whose first or native language is not English should submit official TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) scores.
Interviews and Visits: When possible, each applicant should have a personal interview with a member of the admissions office staff, an alumni admissions representative or a designated rep- resentative of the College. Visitors to the admissions office should make an appointment well in advance of their intended visit. A Campus Visits brochure, giving detailed information on class visits, overnight accommodations and transportation, is sent to each prospective student. The admissions office is open for appointments on weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 to 4:30 p.m., and during the academic year on Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to 12 noon. From June

 280 PRIOR CREDITS POLICY
through September, the office is closed on Saturdays. The office is located in Johnson House, 100 South College Street.
Rooms: In the late summer, all new students are assigned rooms which will be held until the first day of registration. The College reserves the right to change students' room assignments whenever such changes are deemed advisable and to use student rooms of students for its own purpose during vacation periods.
Financial Assistance: Carleton's financial aid policy is based on the premise that the family has the primary responsibility for meeting the expenses associated with attending the College, to the extent they are able. Families applying for financial aid will undergo a "need analysis" to determine their ability to contribute. The difference between the cost of attendance, as set by the college, and a family's expected contribution equals the demonstrated financial need, which Carleton will endeavor to meet through loans, grants and work-study.
There is no separate Carleton application for financial aid. Carleton requires financial aid applicants to complete both the 2001-2002 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service's Financial Aid PROFILE.
PRIOR CREDITS POLICY
Carleton accepts up to 36 credits toward the Carleton degree from the following: College Board Advanced Placement credits, International Baccalaureate credits, or approved pre-matriculation credits (credits earned in college-level courses taken before graduation from high school or before matriculation at a college or university).

EXPENSES
Comprehensive Fee: Students attending Carleton pay an all-inclusive fee, called a comprehen- sive fee, which is regarded as an annual charge rather than the sum of charges for each term covering tuition, room, board, and student activities. There are no special fees charged for lab- oratory work or field trips, or for diplomas upon graduation. All students are entitled to admission without charge to most athletic contests, concerts, plays, movies, lectures and other campus events. These activities as well as subscriptions to the student publications are covered by the student activities fee. For 2001-2002 the comprehensive fee totals $30,780 and it is allocated as follows:
Tuition...
Board and room... Activity Fee...
$25,371 5,250 159
Special Fees: The department of music offers private lessons in applied music. These fees per term for individual instruction in all instruments and voice, and use of practice facilities are: after the drop/add deadline, a term fee of $170 is billed to each student for weekly (normally 9) half-hour lessons (2 credits) per term, or $340 for weekly (normally 9) hour lessons (4 credits). Class Voice, Class Guitar, Intermediate Class Guitar, and African Drum Class are $45 each. Junior and Senior music majors receive lessons free of charge. Students on financial aid who experience difficulty in meeting the cost of private lessons may apply for financial assistance for such expenses directly to the Office of Student Financial Services.
For off-campus independent study, including summer reading not required for a fall term course, the fee for each two credits or fraction thereof is the tuition for one credit during the academic year in which the credit is granted. Credit by examination and off-campus internships

 are charged on the same basis. Optional student health insurance is available at additional cost. Note: proof of health insurance is required.
For students who apply to non-Carleton off-campus studies programs after the deadlines for each term, a non-refundable fee of $300 will be charged. Payment of the fee does not insure acceptance in a program and no refund will be made in case of non-acceptance. "To apply after the deadlines" means completed forms as required by the Off-Campus Studies Office (OCS) are received by the OCS office after their stated deadlines.
Enrollment Deposit: In addition to the comprehensive fee, all students are required to pay and maintain a $200 enrollment deposit which functions as a confirming admissions deposit (see index under Admissions). Charges and unpaid obligations to the College will be applied against this deposit at the time of withdrawal. This deposit will be returned upon graduation, with- drawal from the College, or if the student is dropped from the College for academic reasons.

Students are held responsible for payment of their college fees. The first term bill is mailed before school opens, to the student at home, and second and third term bills are sent to the stu- dent on campus. However, in cases of postponed account settlement, for which special arrange- ments are made in the business office, a note must be signed covering the amount of unpaid balance. An 8 percent per annum charge will be made on postponed accounts.
A monthly payment plan is available through an outside vendor, Academic Management Services for 2001-2002.
Penalties: Students' accounts are regarded as delinquent and subject to penalty if payments are not made at the specified times, or if arrangements have not been made for later payment. The penalty for late payment of fees is $10. A student will not be permitted to register for the fol- lowing term until his or her account has been cleared by the business office. College policies on deposits and refunds apply to off-campus studies; in addition, a $400 penalty is assessed for late withdrawals before the start of the program. See the Off-Campus Studies Planning Guide: Approval and Departure for Off-Campus Study and the student's letter of participation.
Refunds: A refund of 25 percent of tuition will be made if the student withdraws during the first 25 percent of the term; financial aid will be reduced proportionately.
Tuition will be reduced in the case of illness: one-half will be returned if the student with-

The June 1 payment will be refunded only in case of illness before a student enrolls.
In the event of a national emergency all charges will be refunded pro rata to students drafted or called as military reservists unless they have attended courses a sufficient length of time to earn academic credit.
If a student wishes to transfer to another institution he or she must settle accounts in the business office by making necessary payments or arrangements for extension before a transcript of credits will be issued.
No refunds will be made to students suspended or dismissed from the College.
A more restrictive refund policy governs withdrawal from Carleton off-campus programs. This policy is explained in the Off-Campus Studies Planning Guide for each program.
HOUSING AND RESIDENTIAL LIFE
Residence halls are an integral part of the Carleton learning environment providing informal opportunities for students to learn more about themselves and others. Carleton's goal is to pro- vide a living-learning environment which enhances student growth and development through individual and group experiences within the residence halls.
As a residential college, Carleton requires that all students must live in College operated res- idences and participate in the College dining plan. Students with special dietary needs should address their concerns to the Director of Dining Services.
The College recognizes the benefits associated with independent living environments, hence the Northfield Option Program has been developed. Students seeking release from the College housing requirement through the Northfield Option Program must petition the Office of Residential Life prior to each academic year during room registration. Students are exempted from the board plan if they are participating in the Northfield Option Program. Students who are married or have dependent children living with them are exempted from the residency and board requirements.
FINANCIAL AID
Carleton's tradition of extending educational opportunities to academically qualified students and meeting their financial need is based on a deep commitment to the belief that a true liberal arts education exposes students to varying backgrounds and points of view outside, as well as inside, the classroom. For this reason, and the more pragmatic one that many parents cannot afford the costs of education today, the College encourages high school students to apply for admission without regard to their financial circumstances. The basic philosophy underlying the student financial aid program at Carleton is that families have the primary responsibility to

 finance their children's education to the extent that they are able. When a family cannot afford our costs, Carleton is committed to meeting a student's need with various types of aid for all admitted students for all four years.
How to Apply: Carleton is a member of the College Scholarship Service, a cooperative activity which processes the confidential statements submitted by families in support of their applica- tion for financial assistance. The many colleges using the service join in the belief that financial aid should be awarded to students only after careful consideration of the family's ability to con- tribute to the cost of their children's education and determination of their demonstrated finan- cial need. ALL FAMILIES who wish to be considered for financial aid must complete the CSS Financial Aid PROFILE. In addition, the FAFSA must be completed to qualify for any applica- ble Federal and State assistance. No separate Carleton aid form is required for new students. Returning students are asked to submit a one-page institutional application. However, all stu- dent applicants and their parents must submit completed and signed copies of their previous year's IRS income tax return including W-2 forms to finalize any financial aid award.
Terms of Assistance: When financial need is demonstrated, assistance will be granted under the following conditions:
All financial aid awards are made for one year only. It is customary to meet the student's total demonstrated need by utilizing a combination of grants, work study, and loans. With the exception of work, financial aid is distributed equally at the beginning of each term (i.e. fall, winter, spring terms). Student employment earnings are direct deposited to the student and are paid according to the number of hours worked at the end of each pay period.
Receipt of any financial assistance from sources other than Carleton College must be reported to the Director of Student Financial Services. These Outside awards will result in an adjustment in the financial aid package in order to remain within a student s calculated finan- cial need and to utilize all resources available to that student. Outside or private scholarships reduce the student's self-help awards (loan and/or student employment) on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The exception to this policy involves Federal Pell Grants, Minnesota State Grants, and other need-based federal or state grant programs. Adjustments to the loan or work awards resulting from Outside aid are made in succeeding years upon the receipt of those funds.
A complete financial aid application (all forms filed by the correct deadline, follow-up forms completed and returned, and any requested documentation filed promptly and completely) is the responsibility of the student. Deadline dates are "priority deadlines" and will be enforced according to the availability of aid funding for that year. Those that meet the deadline will be given consideration for assistance first. Other applications will be considered according to the date received and current funding levels.
Renewal of Aid: Financial aid forms must be completed each year. A student and his or her fam- ily may assume that the College will continue to provide comparable assistance for subsequent years insofar as the family's financial circumstances remain stable; as those circumstances change, financial aid may also change. It is important to understand that financial aid adminis- tered by the College is not renewed automatically. Parents and students must complete and sub- mit the necessary forms and need analysis documents each year (i.e. Profile and FAFSA).
FINANCIAL AID 287

 288 FINANCIAL AID
At Carleton, financial aid is related to demonstrated financial need rather than academic measures. However, students must be making normal progress toward graduation in order to have their aid renewed. See Section on Academic Regulations.
Types of Aid Available: Special Scholarships: National Merit Scholarship, National Achievement Scholarship, and National Hispanic Scholarship. Carleton sponsors 75 or more National Merit and National Achievement Scholarships in each entering class. Those who select Carleton as their first-choice college (with the National Merit Scholarship Corporation) will receive a renew- able total stipend of $2,000 per year. In addition, National Hispanic Scholars also receive $2000 renewable scholarships.
Bailey Instrumental Music Scholarships are available to students majoring or intending to major in music, and who study and perform on orchestra strings, woodwinds and brass instru- ments. Auditions are required and the scholarship is worth at least $2,000 per year, plus music lessons and support for summer music institutes.
GRANTS are absolute gift assistance. The College neither requires nor expects them to be repaid. Institutional grants represent a reduction in the comprehensive fee. During the 2000- 2001 academic year, Carleton students received over 12.5 million dollars in College-adminis- tered grant assistance. These funds are made available through gifts to the College, earnings from Carleton's endowment, and limited dollars from the yearly operating budget.
Carleton also participates in both the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program. Application for these programs is made by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Residents of Minnesota, including those at boarding schools in other states, will be considered for the Minnesota State Grant Program, also by completing the FAFSA.
LOANS provide students with an opportunity to participate in the financing of their own education through utilization of future earnings resulting from and enhanced by the benefits of their education.
Carleton participates in the Federal PERKINS LOAN PROGRAM. Each year the College receives Perkins Loan funds from the federal government to be loaned to students with excep- tional financial need. Since Federal Perkins Loan funds are insufficient to meet the loan require- ments of all financial aid recipients, they are made available to students on the basis of financial need, with students having the greatest need receiving priority. Repayment begins nine months after the student ends his or her studies. The interest rate is (i\e percent per year, and repayment may extend over a ten-year period.
In addition, funds are available through the Federal STAFFORD STUDENT LOAN PRO- GRAM. The Federal Stafford Loan Program enables students with demonstrated need to borrow directly from private lenders as a means to finance their educational expenses. Federal Stafford loans are insured and guaranteed by the federal government and the promissory note is in the student's name. Subsidized Stafford loans are for students who show financial need not covered by other forms of aid. With these loans, the government pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled in college and or the first six months after leaving college. These loans can be deferred in graduate school as long as the student maintains at least a half-time enrollment status. If no financial need is demonstrated, an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan can be sought; in which case interest accrues from the time the loan is disbursed. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans can

 also be used in place of portions of the calculated family contribution. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans for the same enrollment period are allowed, as long as both do not exceed yearly loan limit. First-year students can seek up to $2,625; second year up to $3,500; and thereafter up to $5,500 each year. The interest rate is variable, capped at 8.25% and repay- ment extends over ten years.
Federal PLUS Loans for parent borrowers can provide additional funds for educational expenses. The interest rate for these loans is variable on an annual basis. The maximum allow- able interest rate will not exceed 9%. PLUS loans are made to credit worthy applicants by pri- vate lenders such as banks, credit unions, and savings and loan associations. Parents of dependent undergraduate students may borrow up to the full cost of education less other finan- cial aid for each dependent student. Borrowers do not have to demonstrate need. A borrower generally must begin repaying a PLUS loan within 60 days after the final loan disbursement in a given academic year. Interest begins to accumulate at the time the first disbursement is made. Normally, repayment is made over a five-to-ten-year period.
SELF: The State of Minnesota's Student Educational Loan Fund (SELF) is intended to help students who need assistance in paying for college, regardless of need. Legal residence in Minnesota is not required as long as the student is enrolled at a Minnesota college. Students may borrow up to $4,500 per year during the first two years of undergraduate study while third and fourth-year student may borrow up to $6,000 per year. All applicants must have a credit- worthy co-signer. The interest rate varies and is currently 8.25% (January 2001).
Carleton also has available a number of commercial loan programs which offer financing over an extended period at prevailing interest rates. Brochures for these programs are available from the Student Financial Services or Business Offices.
CAMPUS EMPLOYMENT is normally authorized to need-based aid recipients as a component of their financial aid award. The dollars awarded in a job represent an opportunity to earn money by working in an on-campus department or office. Although a student may elect not to work during the school year and still receive other forms of assistance, most first-year students find the requirement of approximately eight hours per week manageable. College jobs are normally for work on the campus and include assignments in various departments such as the food serv- ice, academic and administrative offices, the library, residence halls and with the buildings and grounds staff.
Students authorized campus employment may choose to use all or a portion of their earnings to assist in meeting the amount due on their account in the Business Office. Otherwise, earn- ings are direct deposited into the student's bank account at the end of each pay period.
A family may choose to take advantage of a monthly payment plan which is administered by Academic Management Services (AMS). The cost to participate in this monthly payment plan is $50 per year and includes an automatic term life insurance coverage.
Parents who Would like to be protected against future increases may choose Carleton Colleges Prepayment Plan. This plan permits prepayment of four times the total first year com- prehensive fee in return for a guarantee of no future comprehensive fee increase. Detailed infor- mation is available upon request from the Business Office. Although this plan was designed for parents, prepayment may be made by other parties on behalf of the student. The plan is not intended for use by students receiving need-based financial aid.

Support of the College: As an independent, privately endowed institution, Carleton's develop- ment has been made possible by the support of interested individuals, foundations, and corpora- tions.
